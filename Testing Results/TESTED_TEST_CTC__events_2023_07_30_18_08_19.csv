Floatation Tank : Book your session!,"August 13, 2023, 02:00 PM","August 13, 2023, 04:00 PM","102 Lange Voorhout, 2514 EJ Den Haag, Netherlands","‘In the province of the mind, in the inside reality, what one believes to be true, either is true or becomes true within certain limits. These limits are to be discovered experientially and experimentally. When so determined these limits are found to be further beliefs to be transcended.’*As part of the exhibition Gödel Escher Bach, we are proud to offer visitors the opportunity to personally experience John C. Lilly's tank isolation technique. The original concept was devised by John Lilly as a research instrument in 1954. In the ensuing decades, Lilly would go on to simplify and perfect the solitude, isolation and confinement tank, making it safer to build and use even for those untrained in this kind of research. The floatation tank that is available for visitors to use was inspired by Lilly's original tank designs. The floatation tank is a medium for process. It removes 99% of sensory input sources, assisting the user in cultivating an awareness of their internal state of being and attuning to their senses within and without the tank. Similar to meditation, many people enter into a relationship with sensory deprivation practices with certain expectations about what is going to happen. 'All we can say to these people is — nothing will happen that you don’t already know about; nothing can happen that you will not allow to happen, i.e.: “What is forbidden is not allowed.”' The possibilities for application of the tank isolation technique are multiple, ranging from simple relaxation in the weightlessness of the salt solution, pain relief for individuals suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, and psychonautic exploration of consciousness, with many certainly yet to be discovered. The relative lack of contemporary awareness of and research into sensory deprivation is partially due to the inaccessibility of the medium to the public. Floatation centres are scarce and expensive. Especially centres that endeavour to create an environment conducive to exploration, experimentation and reflection are lacking. West hopes to become such an environment throughout the exhibition of the floatation tank, providing an (albeit temporary) embryonic escape through sensory deprivation from life in a cultural climate characterised by flagrant overstimulation. An impossible space for self-interrogation of The Deep Self. * John C. Lilly (1915-2001), The Deep Self: Profound Relaxation and the Tank Isolation Technique, 1977, (Distributor).What to consider before booking a timeslot You will be in an enclosed space in the absence of light and sound for +/- 1 hour, so if you are claustrophobic or fear the dark this is something to consider. However, as there is no light influx whatsoever in the tank, the inside appears more spacious to the user than it is in reality. This often negates feelings of claustrophobia. Even if you are claustrophobic, please feel free to come give it a try. Your session can be stopped at any time if you feel uncomfortable for any reason. You will be suspended in a solution of Water, Magnesium Sulfate, and Hydrogen peroxide (<100ppm), maintained around 33-34 degrees Celsius (skin temperature). The solution has a neutral pH (7.1), compatible with that of human skin. The solution is filtered and treated between each user. However, if any of the following apply to you, we recommend you do not participate in this installation:You have open wounds anywhere on your body. This includes conditions such as scalp eczema, skin ulcers, yeast infections, or athlete’s foot. This is for your own well-being (seeing as the highly dense salt solution will sting quite a bit on open or irritated skin) and for the well-being of subsequent users of the floatation tank. The same naturally applies to any other infectious diseases.You are currently menstruating, are easily susceptible to urinary tract infections, or are in the process of healing from gender-affirming surgery. If you are pregnant, please consult your physician before booking a session.You suffer from diarrhea or gastroenteritis/are living with bladder or bowel incontinence.You have low blood pressure.You are epileptic.You are diagnosed with an acute psychological/psychiatric condition. Please consult your respective mental health professional here, do your research and use your best judgement.Any questions about particular conditions’ compatibility (such as specific physical disabilities) with floatation therapy can be directed towards the contact listed at the end of this information sheet. We strongly discourage any visitors from entering the tank under the influence of any and all mind-altering substances (excluding prescription medications taken at the behest of a medical professional). If the host is under the impression that you are in any way inebriated you will not be allowed inside the tank and your participation fee will not be refunded. The risks of this far outweigh whatever rewards you might have read about. The tank is wheelchair accessible, though please do inform us prior to your session if you require any particular assistance.Please be advised that you will be required to sign a liability waiver before entering the tank.  For more information, please contact us at kevin@westdenhaag.nl!P﻿lease arrive 15 minutes before your session!What to bringTowelFreshly washed bathing suit (optional)Slippers Bathrobe (optional)Shampoo and hairbrush (if you have long hair)Sunglasses for your way home (advisable)M﻿oisturiser - at least for the face/neck and hands, if not a lotion for the  entire body. This can also be applied later at home after your float. Especially important if you are prone to contact dermatitis. Magnesium sulfate is however generally well tolerated.It is necessary to shower before and after your session. Antibacterial soap is provided, but feel free to bring your own.It is best to limit your caffeine and nicotine intake the day of your float.Shaving the day of your float is also not advisable, as the salt solution may sting and cause irritation on freshly shaven skin.

It begins with the Medieval chants of Hildegard von Bingen, the earliest European female composer with surviving written music. The glacier was at its peak size during the ""Little Ice Age,"" when Bach wrote fugues of unsurpassed invention and creativity. In the early 19th Century, Paganini emerged as the most famous violin virtuoso of all time as the glacier began its retreat. Finally, in present day, Muir Glacier has receded to a landlocked, terrestrial glacier, and has been captured in sound in Matthew Burtner's Elegy, which combines live violin performance with field recordings from Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve over the past decade. A parallel story, on a more human time scale, is portrayed in Paula Matthusen's ""Lullaby for Dead Horse Bay,"" which blends a wandering violin soliloquy with sounds recorded through ebbing tides inside bottles on the historic New York bay of the same name.An astonishing juxtaposition of change and loss on a geological timescale, with examples of fleeting human creation that have either endured or perished, ""Deep Time, Sense of Place"" raises questions about what is transient, our place in the grand scope of the natural world, and the importance of protecting beauty of both natural and human creation.Joshua Peckins “Music Speaks” recitals take listeners on an exciting journey from past to present, featuring classics of the past and contemporary repertoire, with rich commentary and stories about the composers and music.

Suffice to say, much has happened. Love, marriage, had a kid, pandemic, moved far away, settled in, had another kid, moved even farther away. Through it all, the unsettling sense that the world is on fire or on the verge of it, at least. So I wrote about it, about this bizarre, transformative block of time -- the overwhelming joy of love and children, of course, but also the anxieties and adjustments that come with those precious responsibilities, particularly in this climate. About giving up one version of ourselves in order to become another. There were many moments when I sincerely doubted that this record would ever be completed, that I'd ever finish writing it or we'd ever get to recording it, but I also think that that additional time made this perhaps our most considered record to date. It's a document of our conversations and hopes and concerns and feelings that I may have otherwise lost to time, so I'm glad that I have it at least. I hope you get something out of it too.As always, my love and appreciation to my beloved band: Jeff, JMC, Chris, Brooks and our unofficial sixth member, Dave. I am so fortunate to have had them play and work on my songs for all these years. It was also important to me to have Cilla's beautiful voice return for this album, and I am so happy we made it happen. This record really reflects my strongest musical bonds -- put simply: it sounds like us.

The Book Chat begins at 6pm.JULIA GLASS is the author of six previous books of fiction, including the bestselling Three Junes, winner of the National Book Award, and I See You Everywhere, winner of Binghamton University's John Gardner Fiction Book Award. A recipient of fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Glass is a Senior Distinguished Writer in Residence at Emerson College. She lives with her family north of Boston.Tom Perrotta is the bestselling author of ten works of fiction, including Election and Little Children, both of which were made into critically acclaimed movies, and The Leftovers and Mrs. Fletcher, which were both adapted into HBO series. He lives outside Boston.Vigil HarborFrom the National Book Award-winning, bestselling author of Three Junes comes ""an engrossing, richly drawn and exquisitely told story of small-town residents grappling with the difficulties of changing times"" (People).""Full of secrets and surprises...A must-read."" --J. Courtney Sullivan, author of Friends and StrangersWhen two unexpected visitors arrive in an insular coastal village, they threaten the equilibrium of a community already confronting climate instability, political violence, and domestic upheavals.A decade from now, in the historic town of Vigil Harbor, there is a rash of divorces among the yacht-club set, a marine biologist despairs at the state of the world, a spurned wife is bent on revenge, and the renowned architect Austin Kepner pursues a passion for building homes designed to withstand the escalating fury of relentless storms. Austin's stepson, Brecht, has dropped out of college in New York and returned home after narrowly escaping one of the terrorist acts that, like hurricanes, have become increasingly common.Then two strangers arrive: a stranded traveler with subversive charms and a widow seeking clues about a past lover with ties to Austin--a woman who may have been more than merely human. These strangers and their hidden motives come together unexpectedly in an incident that endangers lives--including Brecht's--with dramatic repercussions for the entire town.Vigil Harbor reveals Julia Glass in all her virtuosity, braiding multiple voices and dazzling strands of plot into a story where mortal longings and fears intersect with immortal mysteries of the deep as well as of the heart.Tracy Flick Can't WinSoon to be a major motion picture starring Reese Witherspoon""Tom Perrotta is...one of the great writers that we have today. I love this book."" --Harlan CobenAn ""engrossing and mordantly funny"" (People) novel about ambition, coming-of-age in adulthood, and never really leaving high school politics behind--featuring New York Times bestselling author Tom Perrotta's most iconic character of all time.Tracy Flick is a hardworking assistant principal at a public high school in suburban New Jersey. Still ambitious but feeling a little stuck and underappreciated in midlife, Tracy gets a jolt of good news when the longtime principal, Jack Weede, abruptly announces his retirement, creating a rare opportunity for Tracy to ascend to the top job.Energized by the prospect of her long-overdue promotion, Tracy throws herself into her work with renewed zeal, determined to prove her worth to the students, faculty, and School Board, while also managing her personal life--a ten-year-old daughter, a needy doctor boyfriend, and a burgeoning meditation practice.But nothing ever comes easily to Tracy Flick, no matter how diligent or qualified she happens to be. Her male colleagues' determination to honor Vito Falcone--a star quarterback of dubious character who had a brief, undistinguished career in the NFL--triggers memories for Tracy and leads her to reflect on the trajectory of her own life. As she considers the past, Tracy becomes aware of storm clouds brewing in the present. Is she really a shoo-in for the principal job? Is the Superintendent plotting against her? Why is the School Board President's wife trying so hard to be her friend? And why can't she ever get what she deserves? sharp, darkly comic, and pitch-perfect chronicle of the second act of one of the most memorable characters of our time, Tracy Flick Can't Win ""delivers acerbic insight about frustrated ambition"" ( Esquire).",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/east-end-books-ptown-17570781487,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/julia-glass-vigil-harbor-in-conv-wtom-perrotta-tracy-flick-cant-win-tickets-635946421867,False,Boston,False,0.9957802295684814

OSC Booth at Dover Days!,"September 09, 2023, 10:00 AM","September 09, 2023, 03:00 PM","Springdale Ave, Dover, MA 02030","The Dover Open Space Committee (OSC) will have its usual booth at this year's Dover Days. This year, we will be featuring information on the Hale Conservation Restriction (CR) opportunity to keep Hale's 1200 acres (680 in Dover) open to the public forever and further protect the character of our community. As usual, we will also have general information about the open spaces in Dover available for your enjoyment.Less than five miles from the City of Boston, Hale's 1,200 acres is the largest tract pursued for preservation in the greater Boston region in many decades, harkening back to the great era of parks creation in the early 1900s. A CR is a method to permanently limit the ways privately-owned land can be used, forever. The CR will allow Hale to continue to run its amazing programs but removes the threat from development and guarentees public access to much of the extensive network of over 15 miles of trails. These trails are interconnected seemlessly with trails in Noanet Woodlands, Powisset Farm and Dover's Larrabee Estate. In total, close to 3,000 acres of contiguous land will be forever preserved for public access, if the Hale CRs is purchased by the Towns. The land addresses important environmental factors like climate resilience and protecting diverse wildlife habitat.For more infomation on the Hale CR Opportunity, please go to: VoteHale.org ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/dover-open-space-committee-43318732263,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/osc-booth-at-dover-days-tickets-668232028987,False,Boston,False,0.9923386573791504

Adrienne Sloane is one of these liberators, transforming a traditionally overlooked and feminine art form into a powerful tool of social justice.In this presentation, Sloane will speak on her own journey into using knitting, quilting and other textile forms to comment on our current political climate. By visually addressing the frayed and unraveled places around her, her work seeks to promote thoughtful dialogue about critical questions as we navigate the difficult times we live in.

The Women's Convention 2023,"October 20, 2023, 03:00 PM","October 22, 2023, 01:00 PM","400 West Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53203","We’re at an inflection point in our country. What we do in the next five years will impact the next five decades. If we are going to protect our personal rights, our communities, and democracy itself, we need to build the biggest movement possible. We need to consolidate women and allies around shared values, experience, and culture to build a nation that works for all of us. The 2023 Women’s Convention will provide a space for you to rejuvenate and find connection and support. Whether you are brand new to social change work or a veteran activist, this space is built for you.  You will gain tools, make connections, and experience the feminist future we want to live in. While Women’s March is a key vehicle for the new power of everyday women, our Women’s Convention connects you to the network of the movement and equips you with the skills, training, and opportunities you’ll need to become change agents in your own communities.  Learn more: www.thewomensconvention.com FAQsWhat is the Women's Convention?The Women’s Convention is a weekend of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums, creative expression, and intersectional movement building. It will be a place where cause, community, and creativity intersect. We will provide a space where people can meet, share common interests, and engage on issues of civic engagement, accelerated by pop culture. We will engage activists by melding traditional organizing programming with non-traditional programming, including salons, art spaces, screenings, social programming, and women’s workforce development. This convention will leverage the power of culture shift through skilling up and storytelling to create an empowered space of feminist momentum. This event will mobilize and unite movements for gender justice, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, and environmental justice and bring thousands of participants to combine activism and creative expression among everyday people. When and where is it? The Women’s Convention will run from Friday, October 20, to Sunday, October 22, 2023. The location is the Baird Center in Milwaukee, WI. Visit  www.thewomensconvention.com  to learn more about transportation, lodging, and to find our feminist guide to visiting Milwaukee.How much does it cost?General admission is $350 per person—an amount that covers the full cost of entrance to the Women's Convention. If your employer is paying for your registration, we ask that you please register at the institutional level, $555 per person. We also offer a number of other registration levels for movement partners, essential workers, students, youth, seniors, and anyone else for whom the full registration cost would represent a hardship.

If you're interested in getting more information about scholarships, please click here.Why Wisconsin? We’re continuing to build on the success of the 2022 Women’s Convention by hosting it in Wisconsin for 2023 & 2024. Wisconsin is a vitally important state in 2024. Referred to as the incubator for our country’s tribal politics, many pundits think that Wisconsin is one of the states that will be both a deciding factor in the 2024 Presidential election and one that demonstrates the deep polarization that characterizes U.S. politics. With strong organizing, Wisconsin is flippable and Women’s March has the ability to make an impact on the outcome of the election. Women’s March has been making strategic interventions in Wisconsin since 2022, through both mobilizations and electoral strategies. The Women’s Convention will continue that investment with those women and communities who are the backbone and future of Wisconsin. We know that Women’s March belongs to our marchers and that they are the ones that make a change in whatever place they call home. We can support, connect, and amplify what they are doing and can do in their own backyards.Who will be there?The Women’s Convention will bring together over a thousand everyday women activists, allies, movement leaders, rising political stars that reflect our nation’s changing demographics, and thousands of new grassroots leaders who’ve organized in their communities and taken to the streets since January 2017. We hope to make this one of the largest convenings of its kind, and a unique opportunity for everyday women and our allies—from all backgrounds, and experiences—to learn together, share expertise, and unite around collective goals and strategies.What is the program? What can attendees expect? We are developing a program of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums, and intersectional movement building based on the input, ideas, and efforts of organizers from our grassroots movements. Attendees—regardless of prior experience—can expect to be inspired, challenged, connected, and educated. The goal of the Women’s Convention is for participants to leave inspired and motivated, with new connections, skills, and strategies for working towards a collective feminist future. Visit www.thewomensconvention.com  for up-to-date programming information. Want to submit a workshop or idea for consideration? Visit www.thewomensconvention.com Where can I stay?Women's March has negotiated a limited amount of discounted room rates at the Hilton and Doubletree Hotels, both across the street from the convention center.  Visit www.thewomensconvention.com to book directly and take advantage of these rates.Will there be a live-stream?Yes. Selected events will be live-streamed. Are people of all faiths welcome?The Women’s Convention is open to people of all or no religious faiths. We will have space to accommodate for observance and prayer.Will the convention be accessible for disabled participants?Yes! We are working hard to make sure the convention is inclusive and accessible. The Baird Center is ADA-compliant.

In-Person: Poetry Reading with Sally Wen Mao & Natalie Eilbert,"September 01, 2023, 07:00 PM","September 01, 2023, 08:30 PM","5233 North Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60640","Please join us for an in-person poetry reading to celebrate the release of THE KINGDOM OF SURFACES by Sally Wen Mao and OVERLAND by Natalie Eilbert! Please note: Pre-registration for this event is required. By pre-registering, you are verifying that you are fully vaccinated and will wear a mask throughout the entirety of the event.In The Kingdom of Surfaces, award-winning poet Sally Wen Mao examines art and history—especially the provenance of objects such as porcelain, silk, and pearls—to frame an important conversation on beauty, empire, commodification, and violence. In lyric poems and wide-ranging sequences, Mao interrogates gendered expressions such as the contemporary “leftover women,” which denotes unmarried women, and the historical “castle-toppler,” a term used to describe a concubine whose beauty ruins an emperor and his empire. These poems also explore the permeability of object and subject through the history of Chinese women in America, labor practices around the silk loom, and the ongoing violence against Asian people during the COVID-19 pandemic.Natalie Eilbert's anticipated third collection, Overland, invokes elegy and psalm to speak to assault on the bodies of women and our planet. In a collection that is part warning, part rumination, Eilbert snapshots violence -- the scorch marks on California lumber, the discarded tools used to arrest climate change activists, the crescent moons on skin photographed by a forensic nurse. A chronicling of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill and death cycles of the Great Barrier Reef, Overland maps an industry-scarred landscape that travels from coast to coast only to pause on the Congress floor where we are made to recognize: ""Disappearance is active loss."" Whether collective or private, environmental or familial, in Overland no loss is overlooked as sestinas and sonnets are interspersed with weary reportage on the power and limits of witness. Sally Wen Mao is the author of the forthcoming poetry collection The Kingdom of Surfaces (Graywolf Press, 2023), and the debut fiction collection Ninetails (Penguin Books). She is also the author of two previous poetry collections, Oculus (Graywolf Press, 2019), a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and Mad Honey Symposium(Alice James Books, 2014). The recipient of two Pushcart Prizes and a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, she was recently a Cullman Fellow at the New York Public Library and a Shearing Fellow at the Black Mountain Institute. Natalie Eilbert is the author of Overland (Copper Canyon Press, 2023), her third poetry collection. A poet and journalist, Eilbert has received fellowships from the Wisconsin Institute of Creative Writing and the National Endowment for the Arts. Poems from Overland have been published in The New Yorker, POETRY, American Poetry Review, The Nation, and elsewhere. Her articles and essays have been published in Green Bay Press-Gazette, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, USA Today, Better Government Association, The Rumpus, Granta, The Lifted Brow and elsewhere. Born and raised in New York, she lives in Wisconsin as the statewide mental health reporter for USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin.Accessibility: This event will be at the bookstore, which is a wheelchair accessible space. Face masks are required. Seating is on a first-come, first-serve basis. For ASL Interpretation to be made available, please submit a request by emailing events@womenandchildrenfirst.com.

Authors on Tap:  Daniel Hornsby and Alex Higley,"September 07, 2023, 07:00 PM","September 07, 2023, 08:00 PM","410 South Michigan Avenue #suite 210, Chicago, IL 60605","Please join us on Thursday, September 7th at 7:00pm to help celebrate Daniel Hornsby's new novel, Sucker.  Daniel will be in conversation with Alex Higley! About Sucker:Succession meets Bad Blood in this sharp-toothed satire of Silicon Valley and the 1 percent - The black-sheep son of an industrial tycoon starts working for a tech pioneer who's running a biomedical startup selling nothing less than immortality, only to uncover the horrifying truth at the heart of her sublime promises.""Exceptional, horrifically hilarious, and deeply original."" --Kevin Wilson, New York Times bestselling author of Nothing to See HereChuck Gross would like nothing more than to prune himself from his family tree. He's already clipped his name, turning Charles Grossheart, Jr.--son of a billionaire labor exploiter, weapons manufacturer, and climate change denier--into ordinary good-guy Chuck, the ""self-made"" proprietor of an up-and-coming punk label. But when Daddy threatens to cut him off, Chuck is forced to get a ""real job""--and conveniently, an old college friend has just swept back into his life with the perfect opportunity. Famed Harvard dropout and biotech darling Olivia Watts says she is on the verge of totally reinventing the field of medicine, but when Chuck signs on, he soon discovers that things at the vast Kenosis campus are not quite how they appear. Secret labs, vanished employees, and mutated test subjects seem to be as impossible as they are sinister. Is Olivia simply a scammer, or does her technology threaten to usher humanity toward a far bloodier fate? Moreover, does Chuck--who has never accomplished anything without the aid of Daddy's money--stand a chance of stopping her? Daniel Hornsby hilariously skewers the insatiable hungers of the ultrarich in a novel that no one will be able to resist sinking their teeth into.About the authors:Daniel Hornsby is the author of Sucker (Anchor 2023) and Via Negativa (Knopf 2020). His work has appeared (or will) in Bookforum, The Los Angeles Review of Books, Epoch, andJoyland.

Lauren Calve & Joey Frendo,"October 19, 2023, 07:30 PM","October 19, 2023, 10:30 PM","10221 Wincopin Circle, Columbia, MD 21044","L﻿auren CalveLauren Calve has a lot to say.  But not in an in your face way but with subtlety, coolly.  Her lyrics, intonation, and songwriting resonate with the listener leaving them to ponder what they’ve just heard and wanting more.   On her latest EP, Wildfire, Calve delves into interesting territory as she uses memorable imagery and meter to write about complex issues too little found in popular music today such as the increased polarization and divisiveness prevalent in the US and around the world, corporate greed and their role in both the climate crisis and gun violence, women’s’ stories that are dominating public consciousness, and even the precarity of online dating.  Her thirst for knowledge and understanding about the human condition feeds her creativity in a way that she can’t get enough of. Her musical compositions find their ground in the sounds of blues and Americana, guitar and lap steel, but their strength lies in how they go beyond tradition into innovative melodies, structures and arrangements that define their originality.  “Blues music is probably my biggest influence.  It moves me in ways hardly anything else does.  I’m drawn to and try to emulate its simplicity, searing electric guitar lines, and emotive vocal style.”  Calve started singing and playing guitar at the age of 15.  Her family’s love of getting together and telling the same stories over and over painted an Americana vision for her. They’d sit around her grandma’s kitchen island drinking scotch as her uncles compete for the most raucous response to their stories of the cast of characters that worked and lived on the family farm, “the squat farmhand and his family, my grandpa ‘Pup’ and his accident-prone adventures.”   “It’s because of this family tradition that I’m innately drawn to stories.  My uncle calls me the archivist of the family.  I genuinely love engaging with people to learn about their own family stories.  It’s with that same enthusiasm passed down to me from my family that I approach songwriting.”	She attended “a very nerdy liberal arts college” where on bus rides to away field hockey games her teammates and she would be nose-deep in textbooks and spent Friday and/or Saturday nights at the library.  “At my core, I love learning.  I’ve always been a curious person.  And my curiosity has extended beyond academics and into songwriting.”  After graduating from college with an art degree during one of the greatest recessions in US history it was difficult for her to find a job so when a college friend decided to teach English in South Korea, Calve jumped at the chance to join her.  After she came home she went to Wyoming to work on a dude ranch to feed her love for the West.  “I have a long-standing romance with the pastoral American Dream-- cowboys, horses, ranching, all of it.”  Now when she’s not performing or writing songs, Calve is a design patent examiner for the USPTO (Patent and Trademark Office).  “My job is to examine design patent applications and to decide whether applicants’ designs are patentably distinct under U.S. statues.”  All of these experiences and stories she’s gathered along her journey have led her to where she is today with Wildfire.  The lead track, “Better Angels,” was written by Calve about two years ago after listening to a radio interview with Jon Meacham who cited Abraham Lincoln's inaugural address on the eve of the Civil War as inspiration for his book, The Soul of America: The Battle For Our Better Angels. Says Calve: “Meacham applied Lincoln’s message of ""the better angels of our nature"" to the courage of the American people who dealt with the unprecedented crises of their era.  As I listened to this, immigrants were being contained along the Southern border.  Families were being separated; children were held in cages without beds, blankets, or food. Talk about a defining moment in American history and the “battle for our better angels”.  Lincoln's words still held a powerful resonance, and they gave me a deep hope that I hadn’t felt in years. “Better Angels” came from that surge of hope and optimism.  It was a reminder that we would always rise to the occasion, no matter what.” Once Covid-19 started spreading she began thinking about Abraham Lincoln’s message and the everyday people on the front lines in the battle against the pandemic. “For me, they symbolize the angels that Lincoln talked about,” says Calve. “The qualities of our better nature - courage, leadership, resolve, resilience, empathy, compassion, and altruism are all exemplified in the nurses, doctors, janitors, grocery store clerks, mail carriers, delivery truck drivers, pharmacists, and other essential workers.  They are the ""better angels"" represented in the lyrics who ""carry us to higher ground"" while embodying the true spirit of the song and of Lincoln's famous words: ""The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.’”Other tracks such as “On And On” was inspired by the documentary Muscle Shoals.  “The groundbreaking sounds of Muscle Shoals, Alabama in the 60’s and 70’s is part of my musical DNA.”  Intentionally mimicking Wilson Pickett’s style, the song “pays homage to the classic soul music I love so much and is an anthem for anyone who has witnessed a loved one stuck in a vicious cycle.”   “She Loves Waterfalls” is a classic case of a song that comes together all at once: the music, the lyrics, the melody.  “This song came together like that. It all started with a photo of my mom standing and smiling in front of a beautiful waterfall on a clear, sunny day that she sent to me while on a road trip with her husband. Now remarried, they both enjoy meandering through western Virginian backcountry roads in his F-150.”  The photo really moved her. It represented her mom’s newfound and long overdue joy. “And the waterfall in the photo symbolized that joy and the past hardships that had made it that much sweeter.”  Suffering from anxiety and OCD for “as long as I can remember,” Calve hates failing and obsesses over minor details and imperfections.  As a result, her songs take a long time to write.  “ I wrestle with them, think deeply about them; sometimes it takes years to complete them.  Even though I bring all that into the writing process, songwriting has helped me open up. It's given me so much confidence.”  Which helps because she also suffered from terrible stage fright until about six years ago.  “I’m a self-taught guitarist and singer; music was always a private activity.  I could barely even muster the confidence to play in front of my family and friends.”  Curing her stage fright was a pretty painful experience for her.  “Up until two years ago, after a performance I would inevitably wake up in the middle of the night in a panic over something I’d said or done on stage.  It was simply through repetition that I eventually became more comfortable performing.  And don’t get me wrong, I still have my moments!” A Northern Virginia native, Lauren Calve considers herself “a true DMV-er as I’ve lived in the three major DC Metro areas: DC, Maryland, and Virginia.”  Starting with her days attending the open mic nights at the well-loved, but now defunct Arlington, VA live music haven Iota Club and Cafe, Calve became known for her strong, soulful vocal style and skillful playing throughout the area.  Seeing her perform, one thinks of Patty Griffin’s dynamic voice, Bonnie Raitt’s smoky aura, and Ben Harper’s unique slide style.  She released her debut EP, Between the Creek and the Tracks in 2014, for which she earned a Washington Area Music Association nomination for Best Roots Rock Vocalist followed by Light Dark in 2018.  She has become a mainstay at prominent local and regional venues and is honored to have opened for artists like Justin Townes Earle, Rhett Miller, Sean Watkins of Nickel Creek, Cruz Contreras of The Black Lillies, Charlie Worsham and Wade Bowen.  With Wildfire, it brings Calve into a further dimension in her songwriting.Whether playing intimately by herself or with a rocking full band, Calve impresses audiences with her raw performances.  And at the very least, Calve wants the audience to identify with her songs and to be inspired by the vulnerability exhibited in them.  “I want people to know that my songs are a genuine reflection of me.  My dad always says of my brothers and me that ‘what you see is what you get,’  My songwriting is no different.”J﻿oey FrendoJoey Frendo is a man on a mission: to tell stories that speak to the human experience with authenticity and passion. His grit will pull you in, and you’ll stick around for a while once you’ve caught an earful of his lived-in blue-collar storytelling. After building his brand on the soulful hooks and detailed arrangements of 2021’s Stone Mason’s Son EP, Frendo returns in 2023 with his debut full-length offering Bound for Heartache. Equal parts alt-country, Petty-esque jangly guitar anthems, and bonafide Red Dirt twang, Bound for Heartache marks a natural progression for Frendo as he settles into his craft, showing that his new home region has rubbed off on him for the better. He’s not afraid to show his range here — from pedal steel and barroom piano-laden rompers “Fool Hearted Woman” and “Building on Quicksand” to the driving rhythms and pop hooks in “Get What You Get” to the forlorn balladry of “Wild Pilots” and “Nebraska Rain” — each track standing on its own while never once feeling misplaced or out of sequence. “I think more than anything, this record speaks on the stories we tell ourselves,” Frendo notes of the album's overarching theme. “It captures pieces of that dialogue we constantly have with ourselves — how life is always unfolding, leaving you to shade in the details, and how those stories affect where we end up and how we interact with others along the way.” “Old-Fashioned Country Singer” is perhaps a high watermark on the new album, with Frendo calling out: “I think Ol’ Waylon said it best / when he asked If Hank really done it like this,” posing an existential question of how and why we do what we do in life. These introspective, character-driven narratives are a hallmark of Frendo’s output, unpacking emotions and experiences which listeners from all walks of life can relate to. With a heart rooted in his native Michigan and a mind that’s steeped in Southern musical tradition, Frendo is a perfect representation of the ever-evolving greater Oklahoma music scene that brought us beloved fellow acts like John Moreland, Turnpike Troubadours, John Fullbright, and more. He relocated to Tulsa in 2020 during the pandemic, shortly after losing his mother — crediting in hindsight that the one-two punch of major life events inspired this batch of songs. Getting back into the studio to record them over a year later proved to be a cathartic experience. “I honestly felt like I was writing the best songs of my career, and finally starting to really see what I wanted to be as a songwriter,” he recalls. “I was grateful to be making music with people again, full stop, but also to be doing so in a new city with new people who I was genuinely ecstatic to be working with.” Fully embracing this self-discovery, Frendo has now firmly planted his roots in Tulsa and found his identity as an artist. He’s a songwriter’s songwriter, pouring his soul into each and every line, and Bound for Heartache is a triumphant showcase of that commitment. This is but the latest chapter in a story that’s still being written; this is his life’s craft, being methodically chipped away by an artist hard at work earning his keep. “I try to be a student of it, to serve it as best I can,” he affirms of his passion for the trade. “It’s the thing I know I was put here to do.” ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-collective-64874956923,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lauren-calve-joey-frendo-tickets-656341433897,False,DC,False,0.9965100884437561

Jocelyn and Megan’s careers in the wine industry converged at a small Italian inspired winery in southwestern Virginia. Their vision in 2021 grew from grapes without a home, a winery with space available, and meraki- a Greek word for doing something with soul, creativity, or love; to leave a piece of yourself in your work. Jocelyn and Megan are part of a new generation of winemakers and wine brands who see an opportunity to continue to transform the typical archetype of a male owned and operated wine business. They are standing on shoulders of women who blazed a trail in the Virginia wine and cider industries and, with the launch of Daring Wine Company, Jocelyn and Megan are continuing to shape their own future in this industry. They started with two single vineyard wines, a Chardonnay and a Barbera, grown from grapes at Stanburn Vineyard Inc., and a dry cider produced from a blend of cider apples grown in central Virginia. Heron Hill WineryHeron Hill has been producing delicious cool-climate wines from the Finger Lakes for nearly 50 years.  They make outstanding riesling, chardonnay, blaufrankish, pinots, and more.

Squirrel Flower,"October 28, 2023, 07:00 PM","October 28, 2023, 10:00 PM","1940 9th St NW, Washington, DC 20001","Squirrel FlowerWEBSITE | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | TWITTER  |  SPOTIFY  |  BANDCAMP The music Williams makes as Squirrel Flower has always communicated a strong sense of place. Her self-released debut EP, 2015’s early winter songs from middle america, was written during her first year living in Iowa, where the winter months make those of her hometown, Boston, seem quaint by comparison. Since that first offering, Squirrel Flower has amassed a fanbase beyond the Boston DIY scene and released two more EPs and two full-lengths. The most recent, Planet (i), was laden with climate anxiety, while the subsequent Planet EP marked an important turning point in Williams’ prolific career; the collection of demos was the first self-produced material she’d released in some time. With a renewed confidence as a producer, she helmed Tomorrow’s Fire at Drop of Sun Studios in Asheville alongside storied engineer Alex Farrar (Wednesday, Indigo de Souza, Snail Mail). Williams and Farrar tracked many of the instruments, building the songs together during the first week, and then assembled a studio band that included Matt McCaughan (Bon Iver), Seth Kauffman (Angel Olsen band), Jake Lenderman (aka MJ Lenderman), and Dave Hartley (The War on Drugs) lending their contributions.Truth ClubFACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | TWITTER  |  SPOTIFY  |  BANDCAMP Truth Club have tirelessly worked on perfecting their craft, in the process becoming known as one of Raleigh, NC’s premier guitar-based DIY groups. Years of close friendship have strengthened a deep dedication to their musical endeavors. The band formed in the winter of 2016 as guitarist/vocalist Travis Harrington and drummer Elise Jaffe continually ran into each other at house shows in college and decided to collaborate. They were soon joined by bassist/guitarist Kameron Vann, Harrington’s best friend since sixth grade and the person he learned guitar beside. By the end of 2017, the three found themselves in the midst of an eventful year: releasing their first EP, embarking on a two-week tour of the East Coast, landing a spot on Raleigh’s Hopscotch Music Festival, and recording what would become their debut album, Not an Exit. In the next year, they added guitarist/bassist/vocalist Yvonne Chazal to the lineup, and set out on several more regional tours of the East Coast and South. In May 2019, they released Not an Exit on NC label Tiny Engines to favorable reception, garnering praise from outsets such as Paste Magazine and Stereogum. In support of its release, the group set out on a self-booked 25-date tour of the East Coast, South, and Midwest.KnifeplayINSTAGRAM | TWITTER  |  SPOTIFY  |  BANDCAMP Knifeplay is a band that eludes definition, existing somewhere between the nihilistic detachment of shoegaze and the emotional honesty of folk songwriting. They’ve made a slow and careful shift from being the solo bedroom recording project of songwriter, Tj Strohmer, to a collaborative, production-focused studio-recorded band. Through their ever-expanding genre palette, range of fidelities, and a long list of collaborators runs a unique mood that ties everything together.Informed by his experiences living in Philadelphia and their contrast with his rural southern Maryland upbringing, Strohmer’s sometimes straightforward, sometimes dreamlike lyrics feature scenes of darkness from many different aspects of life. He deals with themes of death, drugs, heartbreak, abuse, and self-destruction, all expressed through an androgynous vocal style, which, combined with the band's lush, often dense orchestral instrumentation gives a beautiful lightness to the heavy subject matter.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/dc9-nightclub-18157230091,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/squirrel-flower-tickets-677765503867,False,DC,False,0.9954147338867188

The Court End neighborhood is especially significant to this trial, with many of the key figures involved calling the area home. Please join Preservation Virginia’s John Marshall House & The Valentine’s Wickham House for a look at the homes of the presiding judge of the trial, John Marshall, and one of Aaron Burr’s attorneys, John Wickham.Check-in and begin your dual tour at the John Marshall House--the home of the Great Chief Justice and presiding judge over the Aaron Burr trial--at your designated time. Here you'll learn about the background of this 1807 legal spectacle, Marshall's definition of ""treason,"" his tangential battle with President Thomas Jefferson, and ultimately Marshall's decision in the trial. Following your tour of the John Marshall House, take the short walk over to the Valentine Museum to tour the Wickham House, the home of Burr's attorney, John Wickham. In the second half of this joint anniversary tour, you will learn about the  unorthodox dinner party that took place in the home before the trial and about the broader social and political climate in Early Republic Richmond.

Initially a duo making covers on YouTube during quarantine, Keep Your Secrets evolved into a full band making original music in the summer of 2021, and started building a name for themselves in the DC area alternative music scene. They call their sound ""Cold Brew Core,"" for the monster-drinking warped tour kids who have grown into highly caffeinated adults. Despite their catchy hooks and major-key pop punk sound, Keep Your Secrets’ new EP it's all good explores weighty topics like heartbreak, betrayal, mental illness, structural racism, and climate grief.

Across Maryland, many schools faithfully follow restorative practices and are seeing the short- and longer-term benefits described above. But what if they are just scratching the surface of the good restorative approaches can do?Schools that integrate the restorative philosophy and practices into their cultures achieve all the benefits listed above PLUS they lower their school drop-out rates, diminish the Access/Achievement Gap, raise test scores, and report higher quality of life in school climate surveys. These restorative schools make a positive difference in the lives of all members of their learning community. Across the US and the world, restorative discipline is keeping kids in school and protecting their ability to learn and grow into successful adults. It is breaking the cycle known as The School-to-Prison Pipeline, improving graduation rates, and reducing school drop-out rates by building meaningful connections--student-to-student and adult-to-student.Understand and embrace the restorative experience beyond fidelity to restorative practices with C-DRUM’s Director of Restorative Approaches in Education, Nancy Schertzing. During the morning of this full day session, Nancy connects you to the restorative paradigm through experiences from your life, her life, and the lives of others.  In the afternoon, work with her to explore the vital role r﻿elationships play in learning, and teaching, then practice some simple skills you can use to create your own Restorative Experience.

These poems are “throwing a tantrum” about the climate crisis, written by a “child / of imperialism whining about freedom / from the bondage of stuff.” Nancy Lynée Woo transmutes anxiety into dynamic and playful poems, writing into the absurdity of the global crises facing humanity with a soft wit, enduring hope, and deep love for the more-than-human world. Eco-feminism moving at lightspeed, I’d Rather Be Lightning captures a Millennial’s despair over environmental destruction with bolts of humor, compassion, and formal experimentation.PRAISE FOR I'D RATHER BE LIGHTNING""Nancy Woo's I'd Rather Be Lightning is a necessary invocation. It's a handbook, spellbook, and remembered lucid dream to guide us in and through these times. Clear-eyed about the climate crisis while brimming with love for humans and more-than-humans, this debut collection is a powerful force of language and hope."" Tamiko Beyer""I read the collection with care, afraid I’d miss a single gem about our planetary crisis, along with Woo’s wise and kind eye towards us flawed humans (“Everyone you disagree with//is right in some way”), and the joie de vivre and optimism she offers us, alongside the great existential dread so beautifully depicted, in the playfulness of her poems."" Elizabeth J. Coleman""Nancy Lynée Woo’s I’d Rather Be Lightning is a riotous and candid collection of ecopoems that traverse landscapes and species to tell the story of our changing world. She reports 'Earth’s problems are not getting/ any smaller.' While hope for humanity is ever-present in her work, Woo is in search of the 'eye of life' and isn't afraid to examine the irreparable damage to the Earth and its non-human inhabitants. Using bold language and body-level perceptions, Woo frankly reminds us, 'Just because you want to survive doesn’t mean you will.' Jessica GigotA﻿bout the AuthorNancy Lynée Woo is a poet, writer, organizer, and climate activist who harbors a wild love for the natural world. Her debut poetry collection is called I’d Rather Be Lightning (GASHER Press, March 2023). Nancy has received fellowships from Artists at Work, PEN America, Arts Council for Long Beach, and Idyllwild Writers Week.

Many people don’t realize it’s also the best-preserved historic downtown of any major city in America (with some of the best architecture in the world, including many beautiful examples of the Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, modern and post-modern styles).During the tour you'll see City Hall, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Broad museum and take Angels Flight, before stoping for lunch at Grand Central Market, which is one of the best destinations in the U.S. for food, according to Bon Appetit Magazine, and has dozens of reasonably priced options.

In 1995, they released the Fuente Fuente Opus X, which is considered by many to be one of the greatest cigars in the world. The Opus X was created by Carlos Fuente Jr., who was inspired by the rich soil and climate of the Dominican Republic. He wanted to create a cigar that would showcase the best of what the country had to offer. The Opus X is made with a unique blend of tobaccos, including a rare Corojo wrapper that is grown under shade. This gives the cigar a distinctive flavor that is both complex and full-bodied. The Opus X is also known for its limited production. Each year, only a few thousand cigars are made, which makes them highly sought-after by cigar smokers. The Opus X has won numerous awards, including Cigar Aficionado's "" Cigar of the Year"" in 1996. It is consistently ranked among the top cigars in the world, and it is considered by many to be the pinnacle of cigar perfection.The Cigar of the Night: Arturo Fuente Destino Siglo de Pasion Opus X 100thThe Arturo Fuente Destino Siglo de Pasion Opus X 100th An is a limited-edition cigar that was released in 2013 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Arturo Fuente cigar brand.

The cigar is medium to full-bodied, with a strong peppery profile that is accompanied by notes of dark chocolate, leather, cocoa, and a slight earthiness. It has a long and lingering finish, with hints of spice and oak. And it is considered to be one of the best cigars that Arturo Fuente has ever made.History of The Macallan DistilleryAh, the story of Macallan, a tale as rich and smooth as the whisky itself, laddie. Back in 1824, it was Alexander Reid, a humble barley farmer, who laid the foundations of the Elchies Distillery, later to be known as the world-renowned Macallan. Passing from hand to hand, the distillery found its true purpose under Roderick Kemp, a visionary who saw the potential in Macallan's fertile ground and turned it into a revered single malt producer. Through the decades, Macallan grew, always cherishing the importance of 'terroir', even growing its own barley on their verdant estate. Its fame grew, not just as a contributor to blended whiskies, but as a premium single malt. Macallan's passion for quality extended to its cask management, with a fondness for Spanish oak seasoned with sherry, lending their whisky a distinct flavor and natural color. Come 2018, they raised a toast to innovation, opening a cutting-edge distillery that embodied their respect for tradition and the natural world. Macallan, in its essence, is a testament to quality, setting records and benchmarks in the world of whisky, just as yours truly did in the world of cinema.Showcased WhiskeysMacallan 15 year:This whisky is a part of Macallan's Sherry Oak range, which features whiskies matured exclusively in hand-picked sherry seasoned oak casks from Jerez, Spain.

The whisky is aged for 18 years in a combination of European and American oak casks that previously held bourbon and sherry. This imparts a complex and harmonious flavor profile, with notes of ground coffee, hazelnut, sweet raisin, and vanilla. The finish is long and lingering, with hints of spice and oak.Macallan Harmony Cacao:The Macallan Harmony Collection Rich Cacao is a single malt Scotch whisky that was created in collaboration with the renowned pastry chef, Jordi Roca. The whisky is aged for 22 years in a combination of European and American oak casks that previously held sherry.

The DEATH CAFE hosted by Elizabeth Gill Lui,"August 24, 2023, 02:00 PM","August 24, 2023, 04:00 PM","3910 Los Feliz Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90027","The DEATH CAFE, hosted by Elizabeth Gill Lui and The Philosophical Research Society, is a regular gathering  of small groups interested in sharing in discussions about all things related to death and dying held on the third Thursday of each month. The focus will be open-ended and will follow whatever direction a spontaneous conversation may lead. It is informal, without expectation, and open to all. The Death Cafe will also bring lightness to the gathering by serving tea and refreshments. Admission is free of charge but there is a suggested donation of $10 towards the nonprofit Philosophical Research Society. About the host:Elizabeth Gill Lui is a fine art photographer, published author, and educator. With a degree in comparative religion from Colorado College, she pursued graduate work in American Indian Studies at the University of Denver, and Transformational Psychology at the University of Philosophical Research. She received certification as a Death Doula in March 2022 from the International Association of Professional Career College.She has been a distinguished visiting artist at schools in the US and Asia, and the recipient of grants from the Ford Foundation, and the Graham Foundation and the Rockefeller Fund. Her books have looked at the cultural significance of architecture and the built environment as humanizing aesthetic forces, while promoting the need for architectural literacy. Her fine art work in photography expands that focus to consider the unity of consciousness and nature, the fractal patterns present in the organic world, and the profound connections that unite us all. Further information can be found at: elizabethlui.comAbout The Death Cafe:The Death Cafe is part of a growing international movement of people who desire to reevaluate and transform our cultural relationship to death. Since September 2011, Death Cafes have spread quickly across Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. As of today, there are 14,409 Death Cafes in 81 countries. It includes many people who are committed to a healthier approach to dying, death and burial, including green burials and alternatives to the problematic practices of the traditional funeral industry. Additional information on Death Cafe's origins and its founder can be found at:  deathcafe.com. This event is being held in the upstairs LECTURE ROOM which is accessible by an outside staircase. If you need any assistance please email events@prs.org or phone 323-663-2167.Finding Life at The Death Cafe by Elizabeth Gill LuiIf you are reading this, that means that you are not too late to the conversation—the conversation about Death. And it is not too soon to join in. Growing concerns in our culture point to the perpetual state of denial we live in as it relates to Death, and our blinding inability to be moved by its distortion effect on our psyches. Those effects not only dehumanize us, but force death to rear its ugly head in the least desirable of places, remaining unchecked. So pervasive is death, we seek protection by numbing ourselves to its immediacy. From the macro to the micro, it is not surprising that we can hardly attend to our personal experiences of death with any sense of forethought or intimacy.During Covid, Americans exhibited a shocking lack of unanimity finding common cause against a virus that would kill over a million of our fellow citizens, and over 6 million fellow humans worldwide. We also continue to find it difficult to  register that over 150 species go extinct every 24 hours(1). Or, as one author has noted (2), the planet is on life support, and at best is in the last stage of hospice when all  that remains possible is ‘care, not cure.’ We remain numb in making sense of the escalating  violence in our society fueled by guns on a rampage in our schools and supermarkets, or to the fact that the suicide rate in the US is double its homicides.Over the last two years while witnessing amplified issues surrounding mortality, I pursued several things, all of which in one way or another had to do with confronting my life’s finite timeline. As an aging human, I entered my seventh decade. As a philosopher I read and thought, continually questioning why we are the way we are, with an answer eluding me still. As an artist I spent many months working on my archives, placing them in the capable hands of museums and libraries. As a mother and grandmother, I spent precious time with my family. As an environmentalist, I became one of over 40K climate activists in Al Gore’s Climate Reality Leadership Project, and then, with some more time on my hands, and continuing to weigh the inevitable, I became certified as a Death Doula.Many people are familiar with the role of midwives and birth doulas at the bedside of newborns, but I have found not as many know about the practice of Death Doulas in the world of palliative and hospice care for the dying.As expressed poignantly by INELDA, the International End-of-Life Doula Association—It’s time to care for the dying and those close to them with compassionate engagement and open-hearted presence. It’s time to remember and incorporate the traditions of our ancestors, the inner healing and beauty that can be experienced between people surrounding the dying person. It’s time for us to embrace ‘a more enlightened’ approach to care.(3)Like Birth, Death is not a medical event. Dying often is, but Death is not. Both are definitively human and provide the bookends to our lives. As the movement in conscious dying has evolved into what is now termed the Death-Positive movement, many are advocating for supportive ways we can shepherd the dying through the universal experience of what is, one’s final living act. Central to this awareness is that we need more openness in discussing loss, death, and grief, and in that unfolding conversation, our culture might begin to find compassionate ways to approach the inevitability of this life event. For individuals, the hope is to provide a better way of planning for, and accepting, our own deaths. And in helping friends and family navigate the options for end-of-life care, more openness will benefit both the caregivers and the dying.While reading and studying about death and dying I valued discovering concrete resources for things that we all glimpse in our peripheral vision, but avoid attending to: Living Wills, Advance Care Directives, DNR orders, Medical-Assisted-Aid-in-Dying legislation and resources, and newly developed green burial options including Human Composting (NOR) and Aquamation.Pragmatic all, once on this path, you inevitably also come across The Death Cafe (4). The Death Cafe model was developed in Britain by Jon Underwood and Sue Barsky Reid, based on the ideas of French sociologist Bernard Crettaz, with ‘the objective to increase awareness of death with a view to helping people make the most of their (finite) lives.’ Begun in 2010, Jon launched a project that by 2022 would reach over 140,000 people in over eighty countries. At a Death Cafe people, often strangers, gather to eat cake, drink tea, and discuss death. So simple, yet responding to a deep cultural longing, the level of participation in this transformative communal experiment speaks volumes.As I continued to navigate the subject of death, while trying to live more fully, I approached PRS with the hope of co-hosting a Death Cafe for our community. Our first Cafe was held on 9.15, and will continue monthly, providing safe space for the emotional power of compelling stories, while raising awareness and inspiring action around death, dying, and conscious living.My instinct tells me that if we pay more attention to death, perhaps extend our hands out with the possibility of befriending death, we will embrace it in its life-affirming fullness and natural beauty. At The Death Cafe in September, we found a beginning by personalizing our reasons for attending. I hope you will join us at a future Death Cafe as we further that conversation, and shine light on death, enriching our lives in the process.1 Scientists estimate that 150-200 species of plant, insect, bird, and mammal become extinct every 24 hours, up to 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate.2 William DeBuys.

Bongzilla,"August 31, 2023, 08:00 PM","August 31, 2023, 11:30 PM","428 South Hewitt Street, Los Angeles, CA 90013","Bongzilla formed sometime in 1995 in Wisconsin, quickly composing a host of songs inspired by their marijuana. Very little is known about the early years of the band except for their appearances on a host of split and EP releases between 1996 and 1999, the first being Mixed Bag on Rhetoric Records in 1996. Following a split with MeatJack another 7"" EP entitled Hemp For Victory (Named after the vintage educational/propaganda film of the same name) was released on Thunder Lizard. Two more splits followed the same year and eventually Bongzilla was signed to Relapse Records.The first release on this label was Methods for Attaining Extreme Altitudes released on CD on 27 January 1998. The band at this point made yearly appearances at the Milwaukee Metalfest, notably 1999 and 2000. The band's debut studio album Stash saw it's release on 20 April 1999 to positive reviews. A split with Corrupted, Noothgrush and Dystopia entitled Twin Threat To Your Sanity followed.The band's second album saw release via Howling Bull America (With a reissue three years later via Relapse). Apogee was released on 11 May 2001 and showcased three new songs along with live recordings from 1998. A compilation of all of the band's EPs and splits to that point entitled Shake: The Singles saw release the next year. The band's third album Gateway saw release via Relapse on 3 September 2002.Bongzilla would begin 2003 as part of the Relapse Contamination Festival, with their performance being released as a live album the next year. The band sporadically played shows and tours, with notable appearances at various festivals.A lineup change prompted one Dixie Dave Collins to join the band as their bassist, leading them to record the band's fourth album. Amerijuanican was released via Relapse on 27 September 2005 to positive reviews and featured a cover of ""Champagne and Reefer"" by Muddy Waters. The band toured and remained active until 2009 when the group quietly took a hiatus, their last known show being Forward Fest alongside the likes of Bob Mould, Detroit Cobras and Neko Case to name a few.In April 2015 it was announced Bongzilla was reforming with the Gateway lineup, first announcing a tour of Europe including dates at Heavy Days in Doomtown and Temples Festival along with a single date in NYC. The band followed up with a four-date tour of the West Coast USA, a tour of the east coast USA and an appearance at Desertfest Belgium.Bongzilla began 2017 with a local show in Wisconsin before embarking on another European tour, playing the likes of Roadburn Festival, DesertFest Berlin, DesertFest London, KrisionFest (Their first ever appearance in Spain) and have begun working on material for a new album. Bongzilla have also set course for a 2018 European tour with Dopethrone and Sons of Otis. Bongzilla would tour and perform several festivals in 2018 and 2019. In late 2018 Totem Cat Records would release a 14 song compilation of the Bongzilla early split / live material under the album name Thank You Marijuana. In early 2020, Bongzilla started their own label called Gungeon Records and released a re-issue of their classic album Apogee. However, in March of 2020 it would be announced that Cooter Brown would retire from the band due to health and family reasons, with Bongzilla choosing to continue as a thunderous three-piece. During Bongzilla's first tour as a thunderous three in March of 2020, the tour was cut short due to a the coronavirus pandemic. A few months into the pandemic, Bongzilla began rehearsing and recording for several different record projects - A limited Wake Brewing 7 inch, a full length album titled Weedsconsin, an LP split with the band Tons, and a 7 Inch Split with Boris, the first of a 7 inch Split Series released on Gungeon Records. All projects were recorded at Future Apple Tree Studios in Rockford, Illinois in October of 2020 by the legendary John Hopkins before his sudden and unexpected passing in the late fall of 2020. Bongzilla announced signing to the Italian label - Heavy Psych Sounds on Janurary 21st of 2021. Bongzilla is preparing for the release of their new full length album Weedsconsin, as well as a limited 7 Inch from Wake Brewing, followed by the Bongzilla / Tons Split for the HPS series - Doom Sessions, as well as the 7 inch split with Boris that will come out on Gungeon Records. All releases are scheduled to drop in 2021.  W﻿ebsite-﻿-----------------------------K﻿adabraIn 2020, a year wrecked with cultural dissent and a global pandemic, fellow musicians and long-time friends Garrett Zanol and Ian Nelson decided to create a band that would pull influence from a few of their favorite musical acts. After retaining the talents of their favorite local drummer Chase Howard, the group got to work on writing an album that illustrates their current climate.Kadabra from Spokane, Washington U.S., delivers the eerie psyche crawl of acts like Dead Meadow and the heavy fuzzed riff grime of Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats. In the Fall of 2020, they tracked their debut album ""Ultra"" with Dawson Scholz and released it in the Fall of 2021 on Heavy Psych Sounds Records.L﻿inktree-﻿-----------------------------F﻿orest LawnForest Lawn can be found blowing eardrums in LA’s underground metal scene with their unique style of Heavy Dungeon Metal. No pedals needed; Brett Hanson plugs his guitar straight into a snake-skin Soldano, delivering dark, groovy riffs with an evil tone. On drums, Joe Herzog (Deathchant) mixes jazz elements into his hard- hitting, heavy shuffle style, while bassist Jeff Stephens releases his tormented vocals into the microphone. Formed in 2019, Forest Lawn draws their musical inspiration from bands like Celtic Frost, Slayer, and High on Fire. In 2022, they released their first self-titled LP, featuring dark fantasy artwork from 70s Heavy Metal magazine artist Tom Barber. This album can be found on their Spotify and Bandcamp pages. They are currently in the midst of writing their second album and plan to start recording late this year.I﻿nstagram | Spotify 2﻿1+R﻿esident4﻿28 S Hewitt StL﻿os Angeles, CA",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/resident-18722653542,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bongzilla-tickets-635627718617,False,LA,False,0.9939549565315247

Sunset Strip Tour,"August 26, 2023, 06:00 PM","August 26, 2023, 09:00 PM","8221 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90046","The Sunset Strip is one of the most famous streets in Los Angeles – and that’s saying something, bearing in mind that Hollywood Boulevard and the Walk of Fame are just a few miles to the east. First gaining prominence in the 1920’s, when speakeasies and gambling joints began to appear along its length, the Sunset Strip’s location in the badlands between the cities of Los Angeles (and Hollywood) and Beverly Hills made it perfect for the racy nightclubs that flourished there in the 1930’s, 40’s and 50’s. As the 1960’s dawned it reinvented itself as a rock club scene and epicenter of the new anti-Vietnam war, hippie, counter-culture and then, in the 1970’s, it gained new prominence for its stand-up comedy-clubs that launched the careers of a huge number of famous comedians. Today many of the Sunset Strip’s most legendary venues are still operating and it’s very much a mecca for Angelenos and visitors wanting a fun night out. The Sunset Strip tour is the perfect way to experience this storied neighborhood.We start the Sunset Strip tour at the celebrated Chateau Marmont, before heading west to see the location of one of the first nightclubs to open on the Strip, the Trocadero. We’ll stop in at Carney’s, where guests will have the chance to grab one of their famous hot-dogs, before heading to the Sunset Tower, a beautiful Art Deco gem, where we’ll get a drink in Bugsy Siegel’s old apartment. After that we pass icons like the Comedy Store, Viper Room, Whiskey a Go Go and the Roxy, before finishing at the legendary Rainbow Bar and Grill, where guests can have drinks or eat. Take a trip down the Strip with us.Our tours can sell out.

At the same time, the cost of living crisis, following on from the Covid-19 pandemic, has us all talking more about money – from the price of food in the shops, to the cost of our public services and the vast inequalities in our society. Money shapes an economy riven with injustice, inequality, and environmental degradation. How could Christian thinking inform an understanding of money that creates a fairer, greener future? What would this mean for how we use money ourselves, how money is invested by banks and businesses, and shared via the tax system?As part of Good Money Week 2023, Sarah Edwards from the JustMoney Movement will be hosting a workshop exploring these themes of money and faith and what the impact of connecting them might be.Sarah Edwards is Executive Director of the JustMoney Movement, which has a vision of a world where money is used to shape a greener, fairer future for all. The organisation educates, campaigns, and advocates, resourcing a movement of Christians and churches to act more justly with their own money and speak out for a more just use of money in the economy. Sarah has worked in advocacy and campaigning on social justice issues for more than two decades, most recently at Tearfund where she led their Global Advocacy Team, focusing on the need to tackle the environmental crisis and global poverty together. She has previously led campaigns and advocacy both in the UK and internationally on a range of human rights and global justice issues, including debt relief, human trafficking, tax justice and access to medicines, and has carried out advocacy capacity building with groups across Asia and Africa.Ticket pricesAble to be generous £15Covering the cost £10Limited means £7.50We charge to cover our costs, but we want to ensure that cost is not a barrier to those who would like to come.

Building on the content of Chin’s installation, the speakers will examine the ethics of the spectacle and the prevalence of apocalyptic aesthetics within popular culture. They’ll unpick what role digital technologies can play within climate catastrophe and they’ll reconsider the relationship between ancient narratives and digital realms.

Cette individuelle talentueuse, et une personne rayonnante is s'élève rapidement vers les étoiles et veille à ce que tous ceux qui l'entourent s'élèvent à leur tour.

Les mots ne suffisent pas à exprimer le fait que nous sommes épanoui d’avoir Reda Soui une âme incroyablement talentueuse. Il ne prétendant pas faire dans la facilité. Son regard malin sur la société donne naissance à des propos s’écartant des consensus. Son personnage de scène est attachant et le restera malgré les provocations qu’il peut parfois lancer, gracieuseté de son regard sympathique et de son sourire moqueur.

Eight Bears - Montreal Launch with Gloria Dickie,"August 03, 2023, 07:00 PM","August 03, 2023, 08:30 PM","1841-A Rue Sainte-Catherine Ouest, Montréal, QC H3H 1M2, Canada","Join us on Thursday, August 3rd, as we welcome author Gloria Dickie to discuss her new book, Eight Bears: Mythic Past and Imperiled Future, in conversation with journalist and author Sarah Musgrave!The event begins at 7 PM and is free and open to all. It will take place in-store; please note that masks remain required at the Argo. As space is limited, RSVPs are recommended via Eventbrite by clicking here.ABOUT THE BOOK:A global exploration of the eight remaining species of bears—and the dangers they face.Bears have always held a central place in our collective memory, from Indigenous folklore and Greek mythology to nineteenth-century fairytales and the modern toy shop. But as humans and bears come into ever-closer contact, our relationship nears a tipping point. Today, most of the eight remaining bear species are threatened with extinction. Some, such as the panda bear and the polar bear, are icons of the natural world; others, such as the spectacled bear and the sloth bear, are far less known.In Eight Bears, journalist Gloria Dickie embarks on a globe-trotting journey to explore each bear’s story, whisking readers from the cloud forests of the Andes to the ice floes of the Arctic; from the jungles of India to the backwoods of the Rocky Mountain West. She meets with key figures on the frontlines of modern conservation efforts—the head of a rescue center for sun and moon bears freed from bile farms, a biologist known as Papa Panda, who has led China’s panda-breeding efforts for almost four decades, a conservationist retraining a military radar system to detect and track polar bears near towns—to reveal the unparalleled challenges bears face as they contend with a rapidly changing climate and encroaching human populations.Weaving together ecology, history, mythology, and a captivating account of her travels and observations, Dickie offers a closer look at our volatile relationship with these magnificent mammals. Engrossing and deeply reported, Eight Bears delivers a clear warning for what we risk losing if we don’t learn to live alongside the animals that have shaped our cultures, geographies, and stories.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Gloria Dickie is an award-winning journalist and is currently a global climate and environment correspondent at Reuters News Agency. Her writing has been published in the New York Times, the Guardian, National Geographic, Scientific American, and Wired, among others. She was nominated for a National Magazine Award, was named a finalist for the Livingston Award for Young Journalists in international reporting, and has served on the board of the Society of Environmental Journalists. Originally from Canada, she now lives in London, England.ABOUT THE DISCUSSANT:Sarah Musgrave is a Montreal-based writer and editor with a background in food, travel and environmental writing. Currently editorial director of enRoute magazine's annual food issue, she also teaches journalism part-time at Concordia. Her most recent story in the Walrus explores the surprisingly rich biodiversity of Canadian military bases.",https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/argo-bookshop-15314612085,https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/eight-bears-montreal-launch-with-gloria-dickie-tickets-684346317257,False,MTL,False,0.9937776327133179

But she also likes to get paid.The year is 1998. The Soviet Union is dissolved, the Cold War is over, and Bunny Glenn is a lonely American teenager in Azerbaijan with her Foreign Service family. Through Bunny’s bemused eyes, we watch global interests flock to her temporary backyard for Caspian oil and pipeline access, hearing rumbles of the expansion of the American security state and the buildup to the War on Terror. We follow Bunny from adolescence to middle age—from Baku to Athens to Houston—as her own ambition and desire for comfort lead her to a career in the oil industry, eventually returning to the scene of her youth, where slippery figures from the past reappear in an era of political and climate breakdown. Propulsive and thought-provoking, empathetic yet pointed, Mobility is a story about class, power, politics, and desire told through the life of one woman—her social milieu, her romances, her unarticulated wants. Through Bunny’s life choices, Lydia Kiesling masterfully explores American forms of complicity and inertia, moving between the local and the global, the personal and the political, and using fiction’s singular power to illuminate a life shaped by its context. Lydia Kiesling is the author of The Golden State, a 2018 National Book Foundation 5 under 35 honoree, a finalist for the VCU Cabell First Novelist Award, and longlisted for the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize.

Using a 360 camera and footage captured along the canal, Ford crafts a video based on the unique flora and fauna making the feral parts of the Gowanus home along the water from the “black mayonnaise” to the canal surface. This concert will also feature a premiere by New York-based composer Vicki Leona. Ginger-Flavored Bubblegum honors and recognizes the underlying feelings of rage and loss I feel as an asian woman in the United States – especially with the rise of asian hate crimes in New York City – through the use of poetry from Theresa Cha’s “Dictee”. Other works on the program include the New York premiere of Asuka Kakitani’s Fractured as well as an Unheard-of staple, Doug Bielmeier and Allison Tanenhaus’s Corporate Responsibility Pledge, commenting on the dissonance between corporate promises and the realities of lobbying. This performance takes place on the Gowanus Canal, from the 19th St. Bunker location on August 12th. The audience can immerse themselves in the experience on the Gowanus, enjoying the program from on land or on water. Limited boat access and on-water support are provided by The Gowanus Dredgers. Attendees may arrive in their own vessels, as well.The Cultural Ecologies series is sponsored, in part, by the Greater New York Arts Development Fund of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, administered by Brooklyn Arts Council.​​​​​​​Weather may postpone event.WHAT IS THE CULTURAL ECOLOGIES SERIES?Unheard-of Ensemble, in collaboration with the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club, launches its newest performance series, Cultural Ecologies, an immersive set of multimedia concerts utilizing Brooklyn’s own Gowanus Canal as our stage.

Conover and Lindholdt will be discussing their new books, Set Adrift: My Family’s Disappearance in the Bermuda Triangle, a Mystery and a Memoir and Interrogating Travel: Guidance from a Reluctant Tourist.

See Eventbrite's troubleshooting FAQ here.Tickets:This event is free to attend. Registration is required in advance.About Set Adrift. . .In January, 1958, a renowned sailing family was lost in a storm in the Bermuda Triangle. The youngest of two daughters, Sarah, suddenly an orphan, grew up never knowing her parents and grandparents. As an adult, she began to pursue the mystery of her family and their disappearance, and discovered that their stories were far different from the versions she was told. Sarah Conover’s memoir follows the national media’s investigation of the Revonoc’s vanishing, and exposes the truths that led her to “unstory” the family history, creating a new understanding of their lives, and hers.About Interrogating Travel. . .Never in human history has travel been so accessible to so many. But—amid an escalating climate crisis that threatens the homes of vulnerable people across the world—has the human cost of trekking the globe become too high? Paul Lindholdt links firsthand narratives with research about the travel trade, telling stories of his reluctant voyages while arguing that carbon-intensive trips abroad may be offset if adventurers come to know and love the landscapes closer to home. Tourism may be the planet’s largest industry, but Interrogating Travel advises readers to stay mindful of the consequences of their journeys, whether visiting local getaways or some of Earth’s most remote locations.Sarah Conover holds a BA in religious studies from the University of Colorado and an MFA in Creative Writing from Eastern Washington University. Her poetry, essays and interviews have been published in a variety of literary journals and anthologies including The Sun Magazine, and she is a feature writer and columnist for Tricycle Magazine: The Buddhist Review. She is an award-winning author of six books on world wisdom traditions and spirituality. A recipient of a Washington GAP Grant (Grants for Artists’ Projects), she has also received fellowships from the Ucross Foundation and the Willapa Bay Artist in Residence program. Her memoir, Set Adrift: My Family’s Disappearance in the Bermuda Triangle, a Mystery and a Memoir, will be released in June by 55 Fathoms Press. The History Channel, with a team of scientists and divers, is creating an episode of their Into the Bermuda Triangle series exploring the Conover family tragedy and aiming to find her family’s sunken yacht.Paul Lindholdt, Professor of English and Philosophy at Eastern Washington University, teaches literature and environmental humanities. Coming of age in Seattle and on Vashon Island, he studied in Bellingham at Fairhaven College under Annie Dillard and is working on a biography of her. He has published some 200 books, chapters, journal articles, essays, columns, reviews, and poems and serves several environmental organizations. Besides recognition from the Academy of American Poets and the Society of Professional Journalists, he won a Washington State Book Award in 2012 for In Earshot of Water.

We’ll provide a system for silently opting-out of adjustments during class. If you opt-in to adjustments, the instructors will ask for verbal consent before offering touch corrections. You can change your mind at any time, and any answer is acceptable, so know your boundaries. Anything less than an enthusiastic “yes” means “no.” Our consent policy applies to all situations, including physical contact that may seem appropriate in a clothed setting (e.g. hugs, moving through a crowd), so ask for permission before touching anyone before, during, and after class, even while clothed.No Cruising: Please abide by the desexualized atmosphere of our classes. Don’t ask to meet up with people outside of class. Nudity is not an invitation for personal advances. Also, please do not make any comments about anyone’s appearance (e.g., “You have a nice body,” “Your hair is pretty”). We’ll prioritize the experience of the recipient over the intention of a “compliment”, so err on the side of caution! This applies to live events & online platforms (e.g. Meetup, Patreon).Be Respectful: We welcome all adults who abide by our rules and treat others with respect. Body-shaming or hateful comments of any kind will not be tolerated. Be aware of your gaze: it’s okay to look around if you get lost during the movement, but take care not to stare or focus intently on others.Cell Phones: Cell phones are strictly prohibited while clothes are off, including after class, so please silence them and put them away. If you need to use your phone while anyone is Naked!, please put on clothes and exit the studio. The Erection Question: Signs of arousal such as erections are physiological responses that are as involuntary as sweating.

If you exhibit signs of arousal while socializing after class, please put on clothing for the comfort of some participants.No Latecomers:  Everyone is expected to be on time to hear the rules (even if you've heard them before). The instructor is permitted to close the entrance five minutes beyond the scheduled start time. Once clothes are off, no further entry will be permitted, NO EXCEPTIONS, and we don't refund latecomers. Please do not knock or disrupt class in an attempt to gain late entry.No Lingering: Following the conclusion of class, please exit the premises in a reasonable amount of time as directed by the instructor. Do not wait to be alone with an instructor or student after class.Be Sober: Sobriety is mandatory. If you exhibit signs of intoxication, we may ask you to leave.Responsible Use of Props: We strongly encourage you to bring your own mat & towel, but some of our studios have mats available to rent. If you rent a mat, YOU MUST BRING A TOWEL. Please do not let mats, props, or straps come into contact with your genitals. Be mindful: don’t sit on communal studio props, and put blankets or bolsters UNDER your mat.If you experience or witness a rule violation, please notify your teacher ASAP to help us identify people involved, and you will remain anonymous. While we prefer to be notified in person, you can also email us at info@nakedinmotion.com.

The 1975 at  SAP Center,"September 28, 2023, 07:30 PM","September 28, 2023, 11:00 PM","525 W Santa Clara St, San Jose, CA 95113","After four studio albums, there’s not much territory The 1975 hasn’t covered at this point. Throughout their tenure as a band, the English rockers have flirted with glossy pop, anarchist punk, gritty garage rock, electro-funk and country. They’ve used their incisive songwriting to ask existential questions surrounding self-discovery, nihilism, climate change, mental health, addiction, post-modernism and cybersex. So what’s a band to do when they’ve seemingly done it all? After 20 years together, The 1975 decided it was time for a return to form—a way to celebrate their beginnings and showcase their growth. The result is their fifth effort Being Funny in a Foreign Language—perhaps the band’s most intimate sounding record yet.After two years in a pandemic where technology was a means to cope with isolation, the world—and the band themselves—seemed to be searching for raw moments. Being Funny tries to do just that, grappling with love and loss in the post-internet age. “I feel like people are craving things that are remarkable that require as little technology as possible,” says bandleader Matty Healy.While The 1975’s past few records were brimming with massive production—programming and synths— Being Funny is rooted in performance. “We wanted it to capture the performance of all of us, allowing people to be a witness to a moment as opposed to a witness to some constructs.” As a result, it’s much of a departure from the maximalism of their last record Notes on a Conditional Form. “This album, more so than Notes, is a follow-up to A Brief Inquiry. There were conversations about whether it was literally a part two or something like that, but it was very much his own beast by the end.”Being Funny is somewhat of a rite of passage for The 1975. Healy, four years clean from heroin, left his identity crisis of his 20s behind and felt completely settled into his career as a writer; while lead guitarist Adam Hann had his first child. The band has grown up, and in a lot of ways, settled down. “We’re men now, we’re fucking good.” And notably, Being Funny was the first time The 1975 made a record without strife or addiction getting in the way. With maturity came clarity, and it allowed the group to be more present than ever. “It was the first record where I was like, ‘Fuck it. I’m just going to be here now,’ which is why it turned into sounding more coherent than previous records.” With Being Funny, the band realized their albums didn’t need to broach every topic at once, instead, they could equally be as affecting as contextualized snapshots of a certain period in time. At this juncture, Healy found himself contemplating whether the concept of true love is possible in a world where we’ve been sold this idea of sentimentality. “Are these earnest things like love and connection and community and wanting possible—and are they obtainable against this neoliberal hellscape that we live in?”Recorded between England’s Real World Studios and New York’s famed Electric Lady Studios, Being Funny was the first time The 1975 had sat in a room and played as a band. And this time around, they set some ground rules: They wanted everything to sound as organic as possible, opting for more strings and fewer synths. “We started taking songs that existed or just were a bit confused in their identity and doing an impression of The 1975. But this time, it was live.” They also decided to enlist an outside producer: Jack Antonoff. “I would have never thought that another producer would have come in, especially not a producer that was ‘hot and happening.’ All the people that I’ve worked with, I’ve worked with my whole life.” But their mutual admiration for one another helped propel the project forward. “Jack is just really good at getting the best out of artists, so I really liked working with him.”But the band didn’t change everything, exactly. Like its past four records, Being Funny begins with the band’s familiar—but always differentiated—”The 1975” intro. Flanked by two twinkling pianos playing out of time, the reconfigured opener serves as a stream of consciousness that bursts into a tense, beautiful drone.Despite it bursting with buoyant horns and jazzy percussion “Happiness” showcases Healy’s uncertainty about love in an unstructured jam session that allowed the band to strip the irony out of their music. That idea shifts on “Oh Caroline,” a deceivingly dark melodic pop anthem about all-consuming love, also came together non-traditionally, with an assist from a cohort of creatives informally coming and going from the studio. Full of vibrant. lush strings, the cinematic folk-rock “Part of the Band” is layered with jokes and tenderness, channeling the band’s penchant for pop playfulness. It also comes with a side of self-deprecation: “Am I just some post-coke, average, skinny bloke calling his ego imagination?” Healy asks. With “I’m in Love With You,” the euphoric, narrative peak of the record, Healy earnestly explores whether true love is possible over glistening guitar riffs. “Wintering,” a Christmas song that was originally meant for a Drive Like I Do record, recalls the soundscape of The 1975’s self-titled debut studio album. “It’s a series of Polaroids and captured moments that’s just about your family—the dynamics, the quirks and the beauty of it.”Healy also delves into vulnerable territory with the rootsy, stripped-back “All I Need to Hear”—is a relatable plea for someone to care about them— and on the reflective “Human Too,” where he yearns for empathy. A shoegazey heartbreaker full of warm reverb and delicately plucked strings, “About You” evokes the dreamy nostalgia of Taylor Swift’s “Mirrorball” and Sharon Van Etten’s “Seventeen.” “I know a place/It’s somewhere I go when I need to remember your face,” Healy sings with a wistful lilt. By the album’s bittersweet country-tinged closer “When We Are Together,” Healy once again finds himself uncertain about his belief in love and lamenting the fallout of a relationship. “I’m better at writing’ was just a way to get you biting, oh the truth is that our egos are absurd,” he muses.Like all of The 1975’s work, Being Funny sees Healy striving to improve and trying to figure out how to tangibly do so. And it all comes back to the album’s title. “When I’ve seen people being funny in a foreign language, it’s the height of intelligence, and, therefore, the height of empathy. I think that if everybody was able to be funny in a foreign language, it would probably save the world.”",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/another-planet-entertainment-64242188333,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-1975-at-sap-center-tickets-678306762787,False,SF,False,0.9953966736793518

From the Chinese in the 1850's, to Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, to successive waves of migration from India, Vietnam and Thailand in the last fifty years, each culture has left its mark on the culinary landscape of SF. And we haven’t even mentioned Latin America or Japan yet! Although the Mission District is known for being at the epicenter of Latino culture in the city, its food scene is in fact very varied - and very good.History: San Francisco has a fascinating story too. We start the tour at the Misión San Francisco de Asís, which is the birthplace of modern SF. We'll give you an overview of the city's history, from the dog days of the Spanish Empire, to being part of Mexico, to the Gold Rush era, through the Great Fire and up to today, as the city transforms once again. You'll have a chance to learn all about it.Art: We have some amazing art in the city (especially if you think of the world class museums in the Bay Area), but the Mission District is arguably the best neighborhood for public murals. We'll visit the Clarion Alley Mural Project, as well as enjoying amazing street art like the Women's Building. It's also a great way to get a better understanding of this often complicated - and sometimes misunderstood - city.Join us on our SF food tour and TRULY experience the best of San Francisco.Our tours can sell out.

Eydís Evensen,"October 17, 2023, 08:00 PM","October 17, 2023, 11:00 PM","2174 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94114","“Classical music gamechanger” The Line Of Best Fit“Few artists are so effortlessly able to twist your heartstrings into a contortion of joy, sorrow and despair like Eydís Evensen” Wonderland Magazine​Some time ago, Eydís Evensen wrote a poem. This poem became the basis of a two-part choir composition, describing “a beautiful light that froze,” before concluding with a glimmer of hard-fought hope. “ljósið fagra lifir enn ljósið fagra lifir enn,” echoing voices on the second part of that composition insist – translating in English to “the beautiful light still survives.” The words were a reminder, to herself and to the world, that no matter the darkness around you, there’ll come a point when the pain will begin to thaw, so it’s always worth holding on. “It represents there always being something beautiful at the end of even the most terrible experience,” the Blönduós-born model-turned-piano sensation insists, “no matter how terrible the ordeal.” These words ripple through every note and melody of her astonishing second album, titled – what else? – The Light. It’s a record inspired by the resilience in all of us, she says – our ability to stand firm in the face of personal and collective catastrophe.The 29-year-old – who also sings on the album, for the first time – confronted her own hardships and sorrows in order to create The Light. Some were born from the crises we all endured together: the Covid-19 pandemic; her horror at Russia’s war on Ukraine; her dread that the glaciers and natural wonders of her native Iceland that inspired her to write music in the first place will soon be devastated by the impact of climate change. There were also personal ordeals – ghosts from her past to be exorcised, demons in her closet that pushed her to challenging brinks. As the toll of these situations weighed on her, Evensen did what she always did: she sat at her piano, stretched her fingers and began to play. “It’s always been like that,” smiles the artist. “I remember [as a child] walking to the piano and being able to let something out by playing the keys. It became a therapist and a best friend to me – I always felt better after I played.”Throughout her early life, Evensen never strayed far from that best friend. She played it every day growing up in the 800-person town of Blönduós, whenever her parents weren’t playing Led Zeppelin and Tchaikovsky on the family record player that is. When the composer later fell into a career as an international model, travelling the world, she sought out a piano wherever she was (even once knocking on a door in London when she heard the sound of piano from an open window, so she could ask to play). In 2021, she released her debut album Bylur and immediately found herself touted as a vital new voice in contemporary classical music. Millions of streams on Spotify were followed by millions more on YouTube, where a KEXP live session went viral (one of the top comments on the video states: “this music makes you forget about time” – not an inaccurate assessment).When her equally well-received 2022 EP Frost further cemented her reputation as a glimmering new talent, Evensen should have been on top of the world. Instead, there were historic traumas still to be worked through. It was only after heading back home to Blönduós, and a subsequent breakthrough in her recovery from a devastating childhood ordeal, that the creative floodgates opened for her and The Light really began to take shape. “For two days, I composed and cried. I put my phone on record and just played whatever I could play,” she recalls. “In those recordings I moved through all of these emotions.”Emotion is ever-present on The Light, a record that shows not just Evensen’s personal growth but a musical expanding of wings, too. Opener Anna’s Theme is a competitive float that pulls you into a dream-like state, teetered tonally between heartache and hope. Choral composition The Light II underlines Evensen’s new-found boldness away from piano (not to mention her eventual aspirations to move into film scoring: “that’s definitely a dream of mine”). Finally, horns and strings entwine on the soaring Tephra Horizon before Full Circle begins to pull the album’s narrative back towards brightness – back towards that beautiful light that still survives. Perhaps most personal to the 29-year-old is the track Near Ending. “I composed that piece following my experience in Blönduós,” Evensen reveals. “I hadn’t played it since I composed it and I didn’t want to practise or demo it before recording it for the album. I wanted it to be completely raw. What’s on the album is the only take I did, in complete free-flow.”Why share all this? “I thought it’s important to be honest about these emotions so that maybe it can help people,” says the composer. “It’s been a really hard last couple of years for everyone. In that time, I’ve had a lot of messages about how my music has helped them with personal experiences, losing relatives and going through illnesses. Those messages have been such a gift.” The Light is Evensen’s gift in return – an astonishingly powerful call-to-arms to carry on, because after the darkness comes dawn. It always has, and it always will.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/noise-pop-presents-27658561079,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/eydis-evensen-tickets-607844538377,False,SF,False,0.9944615960121155

Underbelly: The Art of Slowing Down,"August 14, 2023, 07:00 PM","August 14, 2023, 10:00 PM","2820 Seventh Street, Berkeley, CA 94710","Underbelly is a non-verbal somatic practice (freeform movement meditation) where we reclaim our slow in a fast and overwhelming world.  Our dominant culture survives on speed, which keeps problematic and oppressive structures in place at the devastating cost of our well-being and planetary health. Underbelly is a somatic response to the loss of slowness in an increasingly urgent world drowning in climate collapse, AI threat, technological addiction, diseased capitalism and polarization, as well as historical nervous system trauma from continuing racism, colonialism, and patriarchy. It’s time to dismantle the hurry and be in conversation with the present moment.This practice helps us explore the art of slowing down with ourselves, each other, and our current environment. There is space to metabolize our emotions, strengthen empathy and intuition, and develop an intimate relationship with our bodies and nature. We practice being in the questions themselves- listening and yielding to the intelligence of life without pushing, controlling, or fixing. Our individuation and togetherness are felt in a group field—deepening our presence and attunement with one another, co-regulating our nervous systems, being witnessed, held, considered, and noticed exactly as we are. We meet ourselves AS IS, without reaching for more or escaping/transcending reality.  We re-learn what it is to be relational instead of transactional.  To commune instead of consume. To be of service instead of self-serving. To rest back into the vastness and wildness of the natural world, releasing the tight circuits of programming, conditioning, and linearity we've known for so long.  Spend quality time with your body, breath, and being. Voyage beneath the surface of our fast culture, and dive into a slow sanctuary for unearthing what is alive, tender, and honest for you in every moment.​ This experience is not a solution, method, workshop or teaching of tools. It is not a business, ceremony, ecstatic dance, or dance class. It is a somatic gathering space that supports nervous system co-regulation, ample rest, and radical self/community care. About the Creator:Amy Rogg (she/her) is an activator and nurturer of the human spirit. She is half Taiwanese/half Jewish, born in Denver Colorado and raised mostly in the Bay Area. She is the conduit, creator, and facilitator of Underbelly: The Art of Slowing Down. Amy has a B.A. in television/film production and studied acting/improv in Los Angeles. She has also taught yoga (E-RYT 500), meditation, and somatic/relational movement for the past decade.

A sous-chef position at The Madrona Manor lured him to beautiful Sonoma County where he gained the upmost respect for not only local ingredients, but also more refined techniques. After a few years in Las Vegas as sous chef for Wolfgang Puck and a stint waiting tables he returned to Sonoma County to re-focus. He landed as chef de cuisine at Syrah Bistro and then Petite Syrah where the team received a 3 star review from the SF Chronicle. A stint at Scopa and a co-chef position at Campo Fina was also met with raving reviews. After some personal chef work and an appearance on Chef Wanted on the Food Network he was then hired as the opening chef at Woodfour Brewing Company, garnering a perfect food review from the Press Democrat and Best New Restaurant from the Bohemian. Realizing that being chef in a Brewery was limiting he left to seek a better fit. The Applewood Inn was the perfect setting to further refine his personal style and continue to utilize the bounty of West Sonoma County. While at the helm, again he recieved a perfect food rating from the Press Democrat.Today, Chef Jamil works exlusively as a private chef.  We are grateful he agreed to create feasts for us and our community.OUR MENU: TO START:Compressed watermelon skewer with feta, mint, shiso and saba.Blistered padron peppers with smoked salt and lemon.Deviled eggs with smoked trout roe, chives and dill.MAINS:Salad of Arugula with shaved carrots, fennel, cucumber and radishes with white balsamic vinaigrette, ricotta salata and pinenuts.Fregola with little tomatoes, Brentwood white corn, summer squash, pesto and Pecorino Romano.Roasted wild and domestic mushrooms with thyme, garlic and shallots.Braised Beef Shortribs with pistachio gremolata and braising jus.TO FINISH:Dry Creek Olive Oil cake with berries and honeyed mascarpone.Please email us at least 72 hours in advance if you have any dietary restrictions and we'll do our best to accommodate them.Drinks at 6:00, dinner at 7:00.

Barbara Lee is perhaps best known for being the only member of Congress to vote against war authorization after the Sept. 11 attacks, a decision that led to death threats and hate mail. But her willingness to take tough, progressive stands has endeared her to East Bay voters—who have re-elected her 13 times—and liberal Democrats across the country.Now, Lee is running to fill retiring California Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s seat. “We have to ease the burden on the middle class. We have to find a solution to poverty and homelessness. We have to take on the climate crisis. And we have to stop these MAGA extremists who think they can control people’s bodies and dismantle our democracy,” she said when announcing her candidacy. If she succeeds, Lee would be the sole Black female senator and only the third in U.S. history.Lee returns to The Commonwealth Club as part of our “Race to the Senate 2024” series of candidate forums.

Her extensive achievements as a performer, author, recording and visual artist is acknowledged worldwide.Released in 1975, Smith’s first recording, Horses, was inducted into the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in 2010 by the National Recording Preservation Board. Her subsequent albums include Radio Ethiopia, Easter, which included Because the Night, cowritten with Bruce Springsteen, Wave, Dream of Life, which included People Have the Power cowritten with her late husband Fred Sonic Smith, Gone Again, Peace and Noise, Gung Ho, Trampin’, Land, Twelve, Banga, and Outside Society. She is a four-time Grammy® nominee and a Golden Globe nominee for the song “Mercy Is” cowritten with Lenny Kay for the film Noah. Steven Sebring’s 2008 documentary, Patti Smith: Dream of Life, received an Emmy nomination.Patti Smith was awarded the prestigious 2010 National Book Award for her bestselling memoir, Just Kids, chronicling her deep friendship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and the evolution of their work. Her books include Witt, Babel, Woolgathering, The Coral Sea, Auguries of Innocence, Collected Lyrics, M Train, Devotion and Year of the Monkey. A Book of Days, featuring 365 images and reflections will be published in November 2022.Smith holds the honor of “Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres” from the French Ministry of Culture. In 2007 she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She was honored by ASCAP with the Founders Award in 2010, representing lifetime achievement, and was the recipient of Sweden’s 2011 Polar Award, an international acknowledgement for significant achievements in music. In 2013, Smith received the Katharine Hepburn Medal from Bryn Mawr College, recognizing women whose contributions embody the drive and work ethic of the celebrated actress. In 2014, Barnard College Board of Trustees presented Patti Smith with their Medal of Distinction. In 2016, she was awarded the Burke Medal for Outstanding Contribution to the Arts in Trinity College, Dublin. Smith’s photographs, drawings, and installations have been exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide. Coupled with her photography exhibit Higher Learning, Smith received the Laurea Magistrate causa  from Parma, Italy and an honorary doctorate in Euro-American Literature from Padova University. She was awarded The Badge of the Austrian Decoration of Science and Art in 2019.2020 Smith received the literary service prize from PEN America and the Wall Street Journal acknowledged her as a Literature Innovator and in May 2022 received the Doctor of Humane Letters from Columbia University as well as receiving the distinction of being named an Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honor by decree of the  President of the French Republic.Her renowned band includes guitarist and author Lenny Kaye, who she has collaborated with since 1971, drummer Jay Dee Daugherty since 1975, Tony Shanahan on bass and keyboards, since 1996, and her son, guitarist Jackson Smith, for over a decade. BOB MOULDBob Mould began his career as one of the angry upstarts of the hardcore punk scene, and over several decades he's matured into one of the elder statesmen of alternative rock without giving up his integrity, his intelligence, or the fierce passion of his best music. In the early '80s, Mould emerged as one of the founding members of Hüsker Dü, a Minneapolis-based punk band who blended furiously fast tempos with melodic pop structures on influential, groundbreaking albums like 1984's Zen Arcade and 1985's New Day Rising. After the breakup of Hüsker Dü, Mould launched a solo career with 1989's introspective, largely acoustic Workbook, but soon returned to a hard, angry sound on 1990's Black Sheets of Rain. In 1992, Mould formed another band, Sugar, who picked up where the pop-oriented sound of Hüsker Dü left off on albums like 1992's Copper Blue and 1994's File Under: Easy Listening. After Sugar split up in 1995, Mould returned to solo work, dividing his time between guitar-oriented efforts like 1998's The Last Dog and Pony Show and projects like 2002's Modulate that reflected his growing interest in electronic music. Mould walked a middle ground between the two styles on 2008's District Line, but with 2012's Silver Age, he recommitted himself to fluid but aggressive rock. It was the first in a series of albums that reaffirmed his status as one of indie rock's strongest talents, and 2019's Sunshine Rock and 2020's Blue Hearts were celebrated as some of the best music of his life.At present Smith writes, performs, lending support for human-rights issues and environmental groups, primarily Pathway to Paris, a nonprofit organization co-founded by her daughter, Jesse Paris Smith, offering tangible solutions for combatting global climate.

LEADERSHIP WITH SUN ZI ART OF WAR,"August 03, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 03, 2023, 12:30 PM","101 Upp Cross St #05-01, Singapore, Singapore 058357, Singapore","🌟 Master the Secrets of Sun Tzu's Leadership Strategies and Become an Exceptional Leader! 🌟

You've heard of Sun Tzu, the legendary Chinese general and author of the influential book, The Art of War. His wisdom has guided countless leaders throughout history, from Margaret Thatcher to Ronald Reagan, and now it's your turn to tap into his secrets. At Asia Trainers, we have condensed Sun Tzu's timeless teachings into an affordable half-day course that will empower you to lead your team to new heights of success.

Since October 2010, we have trained over 1,137 leaders from Hong Kong, Japan, Myanmar, China, and beyond. Now, we invite you to join this exclusive group of exceptional leaders who have unlocked the power of Sun Tzu's principles.

One of the most valuable lessons lies in the 3rd chapter: ""Win Without Fighting."" Sun Tzu wrote, ""To subdue the enemy without fighting is supreme excellence."" This profound principle holds the key to exceptional leadership.

Let's apply it to your role as a leader:

1️⃣ Your Team: Your Greatest Asset
Instead of viewing your team as enemies, Sun Tzu teaches us to unite and lead them wholeheartedly. Just as you would conquer an enemy state, you must lead your team wholly—mind, body, heart, and spirit. This means nurturing their growth, ensuring their well-being, and inspiring their commitment to your shared vision.

2️⃣ Preserve and Empower
True leadership never destroys the bodies, minds, hearts, or spirits of your team. Overworking them drains their bodies and minds, while broken promises shatter their hearts. As a leader, your goal is to preserve their well-being and empower them to achieve greatness. When your team feels valued and respected, they will flourish and exceed expectations.

3️⃣ Lead Without Leading
The pinnacle of leadership lies in leading without your team even realizing it. Sun Tzu's philosophy challenges you to empower your team to such an extent that they become leaders themselves. Your role becomes invisible, yet powerful, as the team takes ownership and says, ""We did it ourselves."" This is the ultimate form of leadership—leading without leading.

LEADERSHIP WITH SUN TZU ART OF WAR & 36 STRATAGEMS,"August 21, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 21, 2023, 05:00 PM","101 Victoria St Victoria Room (L2), Singapore, Singapore 188018, Singapore","Watch the short video at here
Sun Tzu (or Sūn Zǐ in pinyin) was a 500 BC Chinese general, military strategist, and author of The Art of War, an immensely influential ancient Chinese book on military strategy. Many great leaders like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan study his work and became legendary leaders. Many corporate leaders paid thousands of dollars to attend courses to learn Sun Zi secrets. 
We at Asia Trainers believe that you too can learn master his secrets with just two hundred dollars. This is because we take the essence and compile them into a 4-hour course that will leave you with just enough materials to lead your team to greater heights. Since October 2010, we have trained over 1,137 leaders coming from countries including Hong Kong, Japan, Myanmar and even China. 
The most valuable lesson out of his 13 chapter of 5,000 words must be found in the 3rd chapter: Win Without Fighting. 
 As translated from The Art of War: Generally, in war, the best thing is to take the enemy state whole and intact; to ruin it is inferior to this. To capture the entire army is better than to destroy it. Hence, to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill.
To subdue the enemy without fighting is supreme excellence. In short, win without fighting is the best. 
 How does it apply to your leadership? 

The enemy here refers to not your enemy but your team that you are leading. 

Take the enemy state whole and intact means you must lead your team wholly with not just their bodies, but also their minds, hearts and spirits. 


Never destroy the bodies, minds, hearts and spirits of your team. So you cannot over-work them for you will be destroying their bodies and minds. You also cannot break their hearts by not delivering on your promises and make them give up on you. Finally, you may destroy their spirits when you unknowingly make them a fool in front of others.


To win without fighting in leadership is to lead without your team knowing that you are leading them. A leader is at his best when people barely know he exists, when the work is done, the team will say: we did it ourselves. This is because the leader has empowered the team so much and they have become so competent that they are mini leaders themselves, thus the leader is leading without actually leading them. This must be the highest form of leadership. Lead without Leading. 


If you too want to be a great leader, learn from the master.

However, it's essential to carefully research and consider several factors before investing:Market Research: Thoroughly research the real estate market of the country or region you're interested in. Look at factors such as market trends, economic stability, political climate, legal regulations, and potential growth prospects.Location: Choose a location that aligns with your investment goals. Consider factors like proximity to amenities, transportation links, tourist attractions, and potential rental demand.Legal Considerations: Familiarize yourself with the legal and regulatory framework of the country where you plan to invest. Ensure you understand property ownership laws, taxation, and any restrictions on foreign ownership.Local Assistance: Engage the services of a reputable local real estate agent, lawyer, or property consultant who can provide guidance and support throughout the investment process. They can help you navigate local regulations, negotiate deals, and conduct due diligence.Financial Factors: Consider the financial aspects of your investment, including property prices, financing options, currency exchange rates, taxes, ongoing maintenance costs, and potential rental yields. Assess the potential return on investment (ROI) and evaluate whether it aligns with your investment objectives.Risk Assessment: Understand the risks associated with overseas property investment, such as currency fluctuations, legal uncertainties, geopolitical factors, and economic instability. Diversifying your investment across different markets and property types can help mitigate risks.Exit Strategy: Plan for an exit strategy in case you need to sell the property or liquidate your investment. Consider factors such as market liquidity, potential selling costs, and the ease of transferring funds back to your home country.Remember, overseas property investment carries inherent risks, and it's crucial to approach it with caution and thorough research.

Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htmZenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.comOnce the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs.Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety:Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated. The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content.Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.Session Six - Respond to Questions. Open the floor to questions on a topic of choice.Session Seven - Impromptu Speaking. Learn to organize and deliver an unprepared (no notes) talk.Session Eight - Prepared Speech (Instructor Guided).

W﻿hy ""Tantra"" Speed Date?""Tantra"" has become a bit of a buzzword lately, due to its many misleading definitions. Translated from Sanskrit, it means ""weaving,"" which means bringing oneness to yourself and consciousness to what you do. In keeping with this philosophy...We do our best to bring you and your dates into a state of presence. When you're in this state, our guided exercises will light that ""spark"" for you – no awkward small talk needed!Plus, you'll learn how to bring that level of presence into all your future interactions. S﻿o grab your ticket and get ready for a fun night of speed dating, matchmaking, and conscious relating!* Events do sell out, so purchase tickets online to guarantee your spot.*~ IMPORTANT DETAILS ~* Please arrive on time to check in and receive your speed dating materials.*The speed dating ceremony  begins 30 minutes after start time.  Doors will be closed for the duration of the ceremony.  LATE ARRIVALS WILL NOT BE ADMITTED.  *Door tickets are subject to capacity and gender balance limits.  Tickets are non-transferable and cannot be sold or exchanged.*Please note this is a sober event.  We want you conscious for the amazing dates you will have. If you arrive inebriated you may be asked to leave.~ COVID-19 INFORMATION ~We follow government and venue guidelines that are in effect at the time of the event. These can change, so please check with your locality.  All activities can be modified to be socially distanced (ask your facilitator). If you have flu-like symptoms, or have been exposed, play it safe and stay home. Just let us know and we'll refund or transfer your ticket so you can come another time.~ TESTIMONIALS & SUCCESS STORIES ~ ~""We couldn't have imagined how our lives would be impacted by attending Tantra Speed Date® in July 2017. Our connection was soft and sweet, what we both describe as the 'best first date of our lives.' Meeting in such a vulnerable and safe environment was the perfect catalyst for creating an authentic connection. Having that as the base for our first meetings laid the foundation for honesty and trust."" — Jihan & Joseph~ FAQ ~ D﻿on't see your question answered below? Check out the FAQ section on our website!What is Tantra Yoga?Well, for starters, it's not what you saw in the movie American Pie! Tantra is thousands of years old (of Hindu and Buddhist tradition) and has become a buzzword which unfortunately has some misleading definitions. Translated from Sanskrit, it means ""weaving,"" which we have come to understand as oneness. Bringing oneness to yourself and consciousness to what you do. Exercises involving breathing and meditation are a part of Tantra and are designed to bring you into a state of being more present. And who doesn't want to be more present in their relationships?What is a Puja?A Puja is an intentional ceremony. Translated from Sanskrit it means reverence, an offering. It is a ritual designed to open our hearts and allow us to see the inner beauty within ourselves and all beings. It invites us into the elegant dance of masculine and feminine in a warm space of oneness and connection--what a great way to start your first date!What does it look like?Participants form two circles facing each other. The men form the outside circle and the women form the inside, with each woman facing a man. Each pair then share a meaningful exchange through a directed exercise (a Puja ""station""), which can be for a few seconds or a few minutes. Then they put their hands together in 'Namaste', thank each other and--like a speed date--rotate to the next person. The ceremony ends when everyone has rotated a full circle.What kinds of exercises are there?The exercises are non-romantic, based in human connection: verbal exercises, light partner yoga, dance, breathing and meditation, eye-gazing, conscious touch (holding hands, hands on heart)... things that go a bit beyond the obligatory ""what do you do/where are you from."" And you are always invited to participate however you choose.What's unique is that each exercise has a kernel of positive relating skill. So you're practicing helpful relationship skills while you're having fun!What if I don't want to do an exercise?Thanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators demonstrate what that looks like, so everyone is clear before we begin.So how is this a dating event?What makes this a ""date"" is that you get to choose who you enjoyed interacting with, and we'll put you in touch after the event. We like to let the women choose. The women will get to sense each man's personality and presence and decide who they may want to get to know better. Men will be instructed on how to be grounded and open-hearted so they can be felt. We find when we trust the wisdom of the feminine somehow it all works out.What is the schedule for each event?Doors open at the published start time. That's when we check you in and give you your dating materials (everyone must check in to participate). You also receive a playing card for our Ice Breaker game. You'll have until the ceremony begins to play the game.20 minutes in: We begin to take folks from the waiting list (subject to capacity and gender balance.)30 minutes in: The Ice Breaker game concludes and we close the doors to begin the ceremony. Anyone that hasn't checked in before this time will not be able to participate. (See our late/cancellation policy below).What should I wear?You'll want to look good, yet also be comfortable enough to stand, move, and sit cross-legged. There isn't a tremendous amount of movement; we've had folks show up after work in suits and they've managed okay, but you want to be comfortable to move. Don't worry about shoes, we'll take those off before we start.And remember, you're going on a date. So do make sure to groom yourself and have good hygiene appropriate to interact with potential dates. *Please no strong scents as some are sensitive to that.Is there food or drink at the event?There is no food or drink provided at the event (unless it's a special occasion). It's a good idea to bring a bottle of water. You could bring a snack for before or after (note that some venues may not allow food). However, you will have only a short moment with each date, so you probably won't want to eat during the ceremony. And, there is no alcohol (so please do not arrive drunk) as you want to be conscious for your dates.What is the gender balance at the event?We don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)What is the age range?Some events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. If you see an age range, know that it's not a hard and fast rule. If you're slightly outside the range, or want to meet people in that range, you are welcome to attend.Our open age events are the most popular: Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. The youngest person ever was 19, and the oldest 76--yep!--and he received a standing ovation.But here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!How many dates will I have?Up to 20 dates. Each event can accommodate approximately 40 participants, so assuming a perfect gender balance, everyone would have a maximum of 20 dates.What if I don't match with anyone?As many of our attendees say, ""I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!"" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.05% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!I saw the event posted without a lot of RSVPs. Will there be enough people?Not to worry! Just about every event so far has sold out, often with a waiting list. We do a great job getting the word out and therefore the event is posted in multiple places. And some forums simply get more traffic than others, so don't worry if you see less people RSVP in one place than another. We wouldn't proceed with an event if there weren't enough people to make it worthwhile for everyone.Do I have to be single to attend?One would imagine! We realize there are many classifications of relationship status these days. So as long as you are available to meet a romantic partner, you are welcome to attend. If your situation makes it so you are not open to meeting someone (for instance, if you're in a monogamous relationship), then it would not be appropriate for you to attend.Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?This current iteration of Tantra Speed Date is geared towards men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In the ceremony, we will form two circles: one for men and one for women. That means if you attend, you will have to choose which circle to participate in. For example, if you're in the men's circle, you'll go on up to 20 dates with each woman in the women's circle. And vice-versa. We also have a Queer version of the event which happens from time to time in select cities. You can check our website to see if there are any coming up.What is your cancellation/refund policy?We want you to have a great time at our event. However, life happens, and sometimes you can't make it. If you cancel 24 hours or more before the event you can get a full refund via EventBrite. If you cancel within 24 hours of event start time (or you are late and miss the ceremony start), we can move your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy, provided you give us email notice. If you miss the second event, then sadly your ticket becomes forfeit. Either way, make sure to notify us via email before the event starts, as we cannot offer any refunds or transfers after the event has started.Can I give/re-sell my ticket to someone else?Tickets are non-transferable. Please do not sell your ticket to someone else; it confuses the system and people don't get their proper matches. You can request a refund or be moved to the next event (see above). However, in any case, you must let us know so we can open up your spot to someone else. No notice, no refund/transfer.Can I sign up my friend?Absolutely! And thanks for sharing it with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.What is the Tantra Institute?The Tantra Institute's mission is to empower people to connect more consciously using the tools and teachings of (primarily) Tantra. We hold multiple events, and work with singles and couples to help them increase their capacity for intimacy, authenticity, and pleasure.

If you're in New York, come to our other events, visit us Facebook, or Subscribe to be kept up to date with our latest offerings!What other events do you offer?Aside from Tantra Speed Date, we offer workshops to help increase intimacy and connection for both singles and couples. You can learn about our other offerings on our website: www.TantraNY.comWhy is this experience called 'More than Dating'?This event is more than just a speed date. It""""'s about bringing more connection, and perhaps healing, to the masculine and feminine within us. That""""'s the juicy part of a connection that makes relationships so fun. Men learn how to hold a grounded masculine space. And when that happens, women can relax into their feminine and not have to do or hold so much. This creates a new way of relating that is easeful and connected, and not something you can ever experience in a bar or on a dating app. We believe this is why people love it so much and why one participant said it will 'restore your hope in dating.'More Questions?Contact us, we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.~ YOUR FACILITATOR ~MargaMarga Berlinski is an intimacy and relationship trainer and coach. She helps women, men and couples to feel confident, free and self-expressed in their relationships, intimacy and sexuality. This ranges from people who want to be successful in dating to couples in long term relationships. Marga has been working in the area of coaching, training and personal development for over 15 years. She offers a combination of coaching and powerful exercises that help you discover self-imposed constraints in your intimate relationships.

W﻿hy ""Tantra"" Speed Date?""Tantra"" has become a bit of a buzzword lately, due to its many misleading definitions. Translated from Sanskrit, it means ""weaving,"" which means bringing oneness to yourself and consciousness to what you do. In keeping with this philosophy...We do our best to bring you and your dates into a state of presence. When you're in this state, our guided exercises will light that ""spark"" for you – no awkward small talk needed!Plus, you'll learn how to bring that level of presence into all your future interactions. S﻿o grab your ticket and get ready for a fun night of speed dating, matchmaking, and conscious relating!* Events do sell out, so purchase tickets online to guarantee your spot.*~ IMPORTANT DETAILS ~* Please arrive on time to check in and receive your speed dating materials.*The speed dating ceremony  begins 30 minutes after start time.  Doors will be closed for the duration of the ceremony.  LATE ARRIVALS WILL NOT BE ADMITTED.  *Door tickets are subject to capacity and gender balance limits.  Tickets are non-transferable and cannot be sold or exchanged.*Please note this is a sober event.  We want you conscious for the amazing dates you will have. If you arrive inebriated you may be asked to leave.~ COVID-19 INFORMATION ~We follow government and venue guidelines that are in effect at the time of the event. These can change, so please check with your locality.  All activities can be modified to be socially distanced (ask your facilitator). If you have flu-like symptoms, or have been exposed, play it safe and stay home. Just let us know and we'll refund or transfer your ticket so you can come another time.~ TESTIMONIALS & SUCCESS STORIES ~ ~""We couldn't have imagined how our lives would be impacted by attending Tantra Speed Date® in July 2017. Our connection was soft and sweet, what we both describe as the 'best first date of our lives.' Meeting in such a vulnerable and safe environment was the perfect catalyst for creating an authentic connection. Having that as the base for our first meetings laid the foundation for honesty and trust."" — Jihan & Joseph~ FAQ ~ D﻿on't see your question answered below? Check out the FAQ section on our website!What is Tantra Yoga?Well, for starters, it's not what you saw in the movie American Pie! Tantra is thousands of years old (of Hindu and Buddhist tradition) and has become a buzzword which unfortunately has some misleading definitions. Translated from Sanskrit, it means ""weaving,"" which we have come to understand as oneness. Bringing oneness to yourself and consciousness to what you do. Exercises involving breathing and meditation are a part of Tantra and are designed to bring you into a state of being more present. And who doesn't want to be more present in their relationships?What is a Puja?A Puja is an intentional ceremony. Translated from Sanskrit it means reverence, an offering. It is a ritual designed to open our hearts and allow us to see the inner beauty within ourselves and all beings. It invites us into the elegant dance of masculine and feminine in a warm space of oneness and connection--what a great way to start your first date!What does it look like?Participants form two circles facing each other. The men form the outside circle and the women form the inside, with each woman facing a man. Each pair then share a meaningful exchange through a directed exercise (a Puja ""station""), which can be for a few seconds or a few minutes. Then they put their hands together in 'Namaste', thank each other and--like a speed date--rotate to the next person. The ceremony ends when everyone has rotated a full circle.What kinds of exercises are there?The exercises are non-romantic, based in human connection: verbal exercises, light partner yoga, dance, breathing and meditation, eye-gazing, conscious touch (holding hands, hands on heart)... things that go a bit beyond the obligatory ""what do you do/where are you from."" And you are always invited to participate however you choose.What's unique is that each exercise has a kernel of positive relating skill. So you're practicing helpful relationship skills while you're having fun!What if I don't want to do an exercise?Thanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify, or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators demonstrate what that looks like, so everyone is clear before we begin.So how is this a dating event?What makes this a ""date"" is that you get to choose who you enjoyed interacting with, and we'll put you in touch after the event. We like to let the women choose. The women will get to sense each man's personality and presence and decide who they may want to get to know better. Men will be instructed on how to be grounded and open-hearted so they can be felt. We find when we trust the wisdom of the feminine somehow it all works out.What is the schedule for each event?Doors open at the published start time. That's when we check you in and give you your dating materials (everyone must check in to participate). You also receive a playing card for our Ice Breaker game. You'll have until the ceremony begins to play the game.20 minutes in: We begin to take folks from the waiting list (subject to capacity and gender balance.)30 minutes in: The Ice Breaker game concludes and we close the doors to begin the ceremony. Anyone that hasn't checked in before this time will not be able to participate. (See our late/cancellation policy below).What should I wear?You'll want to look good, yet also be comfortable enough to stand, move, and sit cross-legged. There isn't a tremendous amount of movement; we've had folks show up after work in suits and they've managed okay, but you want to be comfortable to move. Don't worry about shoes, we'll take those off before we start.And remember, you're going on a date. So do make sure to groom yourself and have good hygiene appropriate to interact with potential dates. *Please no strong scents as some are sensitive to that.Is there food or drink at the event?There is no food or drink provided at the event (unless it's a special occasion). It's a good idea to bring a bottle of water. You could bring a snack for before or after (note that some venues may not allow food). However, you will have only a short moment with each date, so you probably won't want to eat during the ceremony. And, there is no alcohol (so please do not arrive drunk) as you want to be conscious for your dates.What is the gender balance at the event?We don't believe in leaving anyone out of the fun, so we do our best to aim for an equal gender balance. Of course, it isn't always 100% under our control--even our matchmaking powers have their limits. But so far, just about every event has been sold out. And since we have an equal number of tickets per gender, they've all had a solid mix of singles ready to mingle! (We also occasionally use door sales magic to balance the gender too.)What is the age range?Some events have a suggested age range (noted in the title and description) and some are open to all ages. If you see an age range, know that it's not a hard and fast rule. If you're slightly outside the range, or want to meet people in that range, you are welcome to attend.Our open age events are the most popular: Singles 30-45 tend to be the largest group. Followed by folks 45+ and then 20s. The youngest person ever was 19, and the oldest 76--yep!--and he received a standing ovation.But here's the thing. It's more than just about the dates. And this is what makes Tantra Speed Date unique. Singles everywhere rave about how the experience itself can be quite transformative, regardless of their matches. Why? Simply engaging consciously with other singles in a positive and structured way promotes more healthy relationships. And it just plain feels good to connect with real people. You likely have never experienced dating in such a fun and comfortable way. You'll gain confidence, pick up new skills, and will likely start to attract more quality people into your life. That's what our participants say over and over again!How many dates will I have?Up to 20 dates. Each event can accommodate approximately 40 participants, so assuming a perfect gender balance, everyone would have a maximum of 20 dates.What if I don't match with anyone?As many of our attendees say, ""I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!"" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 94.05% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!I saw the event posted without a lot of RSVPs. Will there be enough people?Not to worry! Just about every event so far has sold out, often with a waiting list. We do a great job getting the word out and therefore the event is posted in multiple places. And some forums simply get more traffic than others, so don't worry if you see less people RSVP in one place than another. We wouldn't proceed with an event if there weren't enough people to make it worthwhile for everyone.Do I have to be single to attend?One would imagine! We realize there are many classifications of relationship status these days. So as long as you are available to meet a romantic partner, you are welcome to attend. If your situation makes it so you are not open to meeting someone (for instance, if you're in a monogamous relationship), then it would not be appropriate for you to attend.Is this a heterosexual event and is there a Queer/LGBTQ Tantra Speed Date?This current iteration of Tantra Speed Date is geared towards men-seeking-women and women-seeking-men. In the ceremony, we will form two circles: one for men and one for women. That means if you attend, you will have to choose which circle to participate in. For example, if you're in the men's circle, you'll go on up to 20 dates with each woman in the women's circle. And vice-versa. We also have a Queer version of the event which happens from time to time in select cities. You can check our website to see if there are any coming up.What is your cancellation/refund policy?We want you to have a great time at our event. However, life happens, and sometimes you can't make it. If you cancel 24 hours or more before the event you can get a full refund via EventBrite. If you cancel within 24 hours of event start time (or you are late and miss the ceremony start), we can move your ticket to the next event as a one-time courtesy, provided you give us email notice. If you miss the second event, then sadly your ticket becomes forfeit. Either way, make sure to notify us via email before the event starts, as we cannot offer any refunds or transfers after the event has started.Can I give/re-sell my ticket to someone else?Tickets are non-transferable. Please do not sell your ticket to someone else; it confuses the system and people don't get their proper matches. You can request a refund or be moved to the next event (see above). However, in any case, you must let us know so we can open up your spot to someone else. No notice, no refund/transfer.Can I sign up my friend?Absolutely! And thanks for sharing it with your friends! However, do be sure to fill out their name and their email address on the attendee form. Otherwise we will not be able to check them in properly, and they will not receive all the wonderful matches they'll make at the event. If we had a nickel for how many times your friends email us wondering where their matches went... well, you get the picture. So please. Do your friends a solid and fill in their proper details.What is the Tantra Institute?The Tantra Institute's mission is to empower people to connect more consciously using the tools and teachings of (primarily) Tantra. We hold multiple events, and work with singles and couples to help them increase their capacity for intimacy, authenticity, and pleasure. All our events are listed on our website: https://www.tantrany.com/. Subscribe to be kept up to date with our latest offerings! (Make sure to select your city so we only send you events that are geographically relevant!)I had an amazing time, how do I learn more?Most people do! If you're in New York, come to our other events, visit us Facebook, or Subscribe to be kept up to date with our latest offerings!What other events do you offer?Aside from Tantra Speed Date, we offer workshops to help increase intimacy and connection for both singles and couples. You can learn about our other offerings on our website: www.TantraNY.comWhy is this experience called 'More than Dating'?This event is more than just a speed date. It""""'s about bringing more connection, and perhaps healing, to the masculine and feminine within us. That""""'s the juicy part of a connection that makes relationships so fun. Men learn how to hold a grounded masculine space. And when that happens, women can relax into their feminine and not have to do or hold so much. This creates a new way of relating that is easeful and connected, and not something you can ever experience in a bar or on a dating app. We believe this is why people love it so much and why one participant said it will 'restore your hope in dating.'More Questions?Contact us, we'll be happy to tell you more about this event or others.~ YOUR FACILITATOR ~MargaMarga Berlinski is an intimacy and relationship trainer and coach. She helps women, men and couples to feel confident, free and self-expressed in their relationships, intimacy and sexuality. This ranges from people who want to be successful in dating to couples in long term relationships. Marga has been working in the area of coaching, training and personal development for over 15 years. She offers a combination of coaching and powerful exercises that help you discover self-imposed constraints in your intimate relationships.

HackerX uses a speed dating format to quickly connect you with qualified and experienced developers with minimal preparation.Our fun and engaging three-hour events allow you to promote and introduce your company to top developers by leveraging 5-minute rapid chats, along with accurate candidate data to follow up with those that match your requirements without commissions or fees.You Get The Tickets, We've Got The TalentWhen you sign-up for HackerX our sourcing team does all of the hard work of putting the best candidates in front of you. The list of developers you receive with an average of 100+ candidates, is the result of sorting through thousands of technical candidates to ensure they meet your rigorous experience standards and skill set before inviting them to the event.After that,  we will facilitate introductions with candidates.  After the event, you can follow up with any attendee without having to notify us, and more importantly, without paying any commissions or fees when hiring!An Event That Doesn't Take Weeks To PrepareIf you find that events can be tiring, stressful, and take forever to prepare for, you're not alone! In fact, it's likely that you have attended events with long, dull, or irrelevant activities that took a lot of effort to prepare for but didn't provide the value you were hoping for. As experienced event planners, we don't want you to go through all of that!With thousands of events under our belts, you are getting an iterated and tested event format - featuring a simple agenda that allows you to attend with minimal preparation and meet 25+ senior candidates in just three hours of your time.Reducing Companies' Time To Hire With EventsThousands of companies just like yours have attended, met, and hired developers twice as fast compared to a traditional recruiting process with our global events. As a company, we started with small startups, but over time we realized that top developers don't want to meet two companies that are the same. In fact, the reason top developers choose to attend HackerX in the first place is that we bring companies from various industries and sizes together with the same purpose: hiring the best technical talent for their team, and doing so in just three hours.What Recruiting Leaders Say About HackerX""The event at OKTA was a huge success for us - we filled a Software Engineer in Test and Software Engineer for Performance roles with two excellent candidates.""JAN CHOI, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PRODUCT - OKTA""Razorfish and HackerX  put together an event here in New York to recruit local technology talent. The uniqueness of their structure and the way they find talent to invite provides a very rewarding experience. We will likely partner again in other regions and internationally.""ANTHONY ONESCO, VP OF HUMAN RESOURCES - RAZORFISH""HackerX is a great event that connects job seekers and employers seeking engineering talent. BitTorrent participated in 3 events and ended up hiring 3 engineers for key positions.""FARID FADAIE, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF PRODUCT - BITTORRENT""HackerX has been very beneficial for TrueCar as it gives us an opportunity to meet and talk with prospective candidates. The casual environment puts the candidate at ease so they can represent themselves to the fullest. We have successfully hired several candidates!""

Make sure you get some food and refreshments and a bathroom break before the event gets started!""How many candidates will be at the event?""This number depends on the overall turnout, usually we aim to get 80-120 developer registrations. Turnout rates can vary from 70% down to 40% in some markets, so expect anywhere between 25-70 candidates.It is worth mentioning that you will meet more candidates and get more engagement if you attend with 6 people vs. attending with a single attendee.""How many companies will be at the event?""Usually, 10-20 companies will be at the event  interviewing developers, each company has its own table to conduct interviews and developers go from table to table chatting with recruiters.""What's the format of the event?""We use speed dating as our signature format for all our HackerX Events. The event also includes open networking and keynotes, for a total duration of 3 hours.We open the event with sponsor company remarks and finish with open networking. All our events have approximately 2 hours of rapid interviews at your company table (each interview lasts between 5-7 minutes), and around an hour  of open networking, before and after the rapid interviews.""How are the interviews conducted?""Our team will break down companies into two lines and developers go from beginning to end of these lines - spending 5-minutes chatting with each company at their table. Please make sure you do not go over the established interviewing time to ensure the session is smooth for all parties involved.""I cannot find where the event is taking place or it just lists TBD in the location field, where is the event happening?""We don't post a venue address on our event pages until we have all the details.

Your event start time can be found on your event tickets, if you have any questions, please reach out to the event organizer.Candidate Related Questions""Where do you get your developers from?""Our sourcing team uses our own internal database in addition to leveraging targeted campaigns to find candidates across different platforms. We then sort and filter candidates to ensure developers meet our requirements before inviting them to attend. Upon signing up to attend developers provide us with their profile information which will be shared with you on the day of the event via the developer list. ""What information is included on the Developer List?""Our developer lists include all candidates': Names, Emails, LinkedIn Profile, Current Company, Current Job Title, Education, Years of Experience, and Programming Skills.This list is shared with your attendees on the morning of the event.""Where are your developers located?""For Onsite Events, all developers are living and working in the Metropolitan Area of the city listed in the event title. Metropolitan Areas vary from city to city, for that reason we ensure both companies and developers are within a reasonable commuting distance.""I am looking for a specific programming language/role, how can I know if the event is worth attending?""For common skills and frameworks such as  Agile, SQL,  JavaScript, HTML, Python, Java, CSS, jQuery, Node.js, .NET, React, C, PHP, and AngularJS, we will have dozens of developers with those skills and should not be an issue to find experienced candidates. However, if you require a specific framework or skill not listed, please contact us at sales@hackerx.org with the openings that you need help with. Our teams can check the number of developers that match those skills before you sign up.""How can I prepare for the 5-minute speed interviews with candidates?""Preparation is key. Before you even get to the event, we recommend allotting at least an hour of your morning to review the developer list for the evening. This will allow you to assess which candidates are you interested in the most and craft a list of questions to ask.Not all interviews are created equal, after witnessing thousands of interviews we have compiled a list of best practices:- Write down the candidate's name and/or locate them in the developer list as soon as they sit: Speed interviews can feel very short, throughout the night you will probably speak with 30+ people, and after a few interviews it's easy to forgo writing notes, only to find out that you don't know who you need to follow-up with the day after the event. To avoid that situation, make sure you have the candidate's name and contact details before starting to chat. If you are using a developer list, you can use that spreadsheet to write down notes directly, if you are using pen and paper, simply write down the interview notes below.- Start with calibration questions: These types of questions are not only great ice-breakers but will provide you with a very good idea of where the conversation will progress from there. Some examples of calibration questions are:Are you actively looking for a new role?  Some candidates are more active, some may be more passive. This question will allow you to assess the candidate's eagerness to move into a new position. The candidate's answer will let you know the approximate time to hire, their expectations and the overall direction of the conversation.What would it take you to move into a new company? This is a great variation of the question above. Most candidates will not only answer if they are actively looking for a new role, but they will also give you some insights into what they would need to make that decision. This could be higher compensation, better job title, better work-life balance, remote work, challenging projects, better career prospects, etc. Identifying these details early on can be the difference between a rejected offer or a hire at the end of the process.What made you attend HackerX?The answer to this query will give you the reason why they wanted to come to the event. Some people are eager to change jobs, others want to network with companies and developers alike, others want to hear bout new products or technologies etc. It's important to understand where each candidate is at before jumping into role-related questioning- Prepare your company's elevator pitch: Unless you are a sponsor or a very well-recognized employer, most developers won't really have a lot of information about your organization. It's important that you have a 1-minute company pitch ready for candidates that covers the size, industry, and products/services of your business. The best approach to this is to first introduce yourself, your job title, what you do and how long have you been in the organization and give the elevator pitch after. -  Write down role-related questions and  keep those consistent throughout the night: When you finish your calibration questions,  make sure that your role-related questions are consistent so you can compare candidate's competencies evenly, this will allow you to prioritize certain candidates over others as well as maintaining an equitable hiring process that considers technical competencies, communication skills, and overall culture fit.""Five minutes is a very short time, how can I assess a candidate's fit with a short conversation?""5 minutes may not be a lot of time, but if you follow our best practices, you will probably have a good picture of what candidates you want to do follow-ups with. The reason why this approach works is that there's no pressure on either side because it's just five minutes. Candidates do not need to spend 30 minutes on a screening call, and you can reduce your time-to-hire substantially because we have already done the sourcing and screening for you.""If we meet a candidate that is a good fit for our team, how do we go about taking the next steps?"" Our team provides you with the full list of developers  on the day of the event, you may use the contact list to get in touch with any of the candidates and move on to the next steps in the hiring process. You do not need to liaise with HackerX or pay fees or commissions in order to move forward with any of the candidates.""Can we preselect candidates before interviewing them?"" The speed interviewing format does not allow for us to preselect candidates, since we want all candidates to speak with all companies. Even if a candidate is not a good fit initially, they may have a friend/coworker/neighbour/colleague that is the perfect fit for that position, so make sure you leave a good impression on all candidates and that you leverage their professional network.""Can we get in contact with any candidate on the developer list?""Yes, upon signing up for an event our candidates acknowledge our privacy policy and data sharing agreement which is GDPR compliant. As a registered employer, you may contact any of the candidates by any of the means provided on the developer list. Keep in mind that candidates shall have the right to access, rectify, object, or erase any or all of their personal data at any time and that any data requests sent to you by HackerX or by the data subject shall be fulfilled by your company as the controller of  that data.""What is the success rate?""The success rate varies by event and depends on many variables, many of those being outside of our scope. On average we see 20% of registrants reporting getting an offer as a result of the event, which means on average 20 offers per 100 registrants. That figure is substantially higher than a traditional career fair.Billing Questions""What currency do you use for tickets?""All of our ticket prices are in US Dollars.""I registered and paid via credit card through Eventbrite, can I get an invoice?""Yes, our Billing Team will send you a receipt with your ticket purchase along with a link to  a form where you can modify the billing details on your invoice. If you choose to modify those details, our billing team will send a new invoice with the updated details provided by you.""I want to attend the event, but our company does not allow us to pay via credit card, can we use an invoice instead?""Yes, to pay via invoice you will need to confirm with us the event that you want to attend as well as the ticket tier you want to purchase. You will also need to fill out the following onboarding form: www.hackerx.org/onboardingPlease email us with the event details and ticket tier at sales@hackerx.org upon completing the onboarding form.""I registered to attend but I am not able to make it, can I get a refund?"" Ticket refunds are only possible if you request your refund 30 days before the event. Nonetheless, we understand that some circumstances do not allow that much notice.If that is the case, please reach out to us with your specific request via sales@hackerx.org and our team will work with you to offer an alternative.""We want to attend this event, but we are on a budget, do you offer any discounts?""Yes, we have several discounts available: - Early-Bird Discounts: Our early-bird tickets are sold at the very beginning of our event campaign and don't last long.

Women Embracing Desires: A Workshop of Self-Discovery and Empowerment,"August 26, 2023, 10:00 AM","August 26, 2023, 05:00 PM","24D Tt. Vasumweg, 1033 SC Amsterdam, Netherlands","We all have desires that shape different aspects of our lives: romance, relationships, friendships, at home, at work, and in moments of intimacy. Yet, at times, it can be challenging to identify our desires, express them openly, and allow ourselves to pursue them wholeheartedly. The vulnerability of acting on our desires can make us hesitate or feel uncertain. On the 26th of August we will explore and gently shake up this world of desires. Where we explore playful ways to practice and inquire into this beautiful topic.As women, we often grapple with questions like:•	""What if expressing my desire leads to a negative response from others?""•	""How can I confidently say 'no' when my desires clash with someone else's expectations?""•	""How do I establish clear boundaries and prioritize self-care?""•	""How can I overcome hesitation and ask for what I truly want with confidence?""•	""How do I remain connected to my joy and body, avoiding overthinking and shutting down?""Desire is indeed a vulnerable topic, but together, we will embark on a journey to find gentle and loving ways to open ourselves up to what we want, asking for it in an inviting manner rather than demanding it. We understand that women often suppress their desires, prioritizing the needs of others while neglecting their own. This avoidance of intimacy can leave us feeling empty, frustrated, and sensing that something is missing from our lives.The truth is, expressing ourselves powerfully and freely in this area of life is a skill we haven't fully developed, and we didn't grow up in environments that encouraged open dialogue on these matters. Now is the time to educate ourselves, to nourish and provide the loving attention we deserve.In this day workshop, we will guide you through exercises designed to liberate and connect you to your desires. Together, we will:•	Create a safe space where you can be authentically yourself, discovering that you are not alone on this journey.•	Engage in exercises that empower you to articulate your desires, finding your unique self-expression.•	Share and connect with other women, inspiring and encouraging one another to embrace new levels of vulnerability and self-revelation.•	Learn effective communication techniques to express what you want in an open and inviting way.•	Practice setting boundaries that honor your desires and protect your well-being.•	Depart with practical tools and practices to implement in your daily life, supporting your ongoing journey of self-expression.•	Explore exercises that help you connect with your senses and body, guiding you to uncover your deepest desires and needs.Please note that there will be no nudity in this workshop. You participate on a level that feels comfortable to you and you can always opt out of an exercise.  To ensure individual attention and a supportive environment, the group will be limited to a maximum of 14 participants.Workshop DetailsDate: Saturday, 26th of AugustTime: 10:30 AM – 5:00 PM (Doors open at 10:00 AM)Location: Noord Straalt,  Tt.

Free your body and mind - with Bess Kuil,"September 24, 2023, 02:00 PM","September 24, 2023, 05:00 PM","Ter Gouwstraat 3, 1093 JX Amsterdam, Netherlands","Freedom in the body can create freedom in the mind.  During the first part of the workshop, I’ll try to let you experience a glimpse of what freedom in the body can feel like and how that can lead to freedom in the mind. After this part, I’ll give you some theoretical background information about what you’ve probably just experienced and how this can help you to create more freedom and joy in your life. During the second part of the workshop, I’ll do one or two one on one body reading sessions in the presence of the group. A body reading will bring you awareness about your physical non-verbal communication. Non-verbal communication is determined by the energy in your body. Being aware of this energy and how it influences your mood, feelings, and interactions with others is the first step. The next step is to be-friend and become master of your body, and to experience feeling relaxed, free , and joyful throughout your regular days.We hope that this workshop helps you to access and start to master the freedom you can experience within yourself. A﻿BOUT BESS Bess Kuil is a dancer, performer, choreographer, body & mind coach,  and dance teacher based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Her classes and performances are mainly about body awareness, physical communication, transformation, personal growth, freedom in movement and the joy of dancing.Apart from a dancer Bess is also a nurse with 11 years of experience working in different mental and physical health care institutions. One of the things that intrigues her the most as a nurse is the effect of the physical state on the mental state and via versa. In the private body & mind sessions she combines her experiences and knowledge as a nurse and as a dancer. She always starts working from the body which can lead to therapeutical conversations, body reading, painting or writing. Whatever the needs are of the client.TICKETSEarly Bird: € 12.50Regular Price: € 17.50Included: workshop, networking drinks and snacks after the event, good vibes.With your ticket, we will arrange the drinks and snacks.

Roffa Mon Amour x Nieuwe Instituut: Ponyo,"October 20, 2023, 08:00 PM","October 20, 2023, 11:00 PM","Museumpark 25, 3015 CB Rotterdam, Netherlands","As part of the exhibition Water Cities Rotterdam. By Kunlé Adeyemi the Rotterdam film platform Roffa Mon Amour presents films related to our changing water world. On the evening of 20 October, the film Ponyo (2008) by Hayao Miyazaki will be screened at the Nieuwe Instituut.PonyoFive-year old Sosuke lives with his mother Lisa and father at the shore of a cliff. His father is a captain and away from home a lot. His mother works at a retirement home and often brings Sosuke with her. While driving along the coastline Sosuka spots a very cute little sea creature which gets his attention. He catches the fish, calls her Ponyo and brings her to the retirement home where the elderly are shocked because ‘fish with faces’ can cause a tsunami. Ponyo and Sosuke become close buddies. But soon after the babbling ocean becomes turbulent and monstrous waves take over the town and Sosuke loses his new friend. Ponyo doesn’t belong on the land and is part of a major project from Fujimoto, a sea wizard who clones fish to keep nature in balance. Fujimoto is furious and puts all his effort into getting Ponyo back to his master submarine. But Ponyo dreams of becoming human. Sosuke is faced with an underwater challenge which will determine whether Ponyo can transform into human for good. While watching Ponyo again we started to ask ourselves what will it look like if human bodies have to adapt to future environment with rising sea levels.  What if we would partly live under water? Will our skin become water resistant? Will our feet transform into flippers and how will our respiratory system adapt? Seemingly a playful fairy tale, Ponyo is way more than a cute animation. With the power imagination and the magic of illustration new worlds with new principles are created. Water Cities Rotterdam ProgrammeFor the exhibition Water Cities Rotterdam. By Kunlé Adeyemi, Nieuwe Instituut organises an extensive public programme with activities linked to themes explored in the exhibition and on the floating pavilions in the ponds around the institute, from Sunday morning yoga to documentaries, and from talk shows to live radio.

Cultures of Thinking in Action: An Inquiry into 10 Guiding Mindsets,"November 30, 2023, 08:00 AM","December 01, 2023, 04:00 PM","45 Sportlaan, 1185 TB Amstelveen, Netherlands","Explore the 10 foundational mindsets needed to create a robust culture of thinking in your classroom and/or school context. These mindsets motivate and guide our actions and provide the touchstones we need as we create places where thinking is valued, visible, and actively promoted. As we do so, we will look at the research behind these principles, the actions and data that can be used to move us forward in whatever teaching and learning environments we find ourselves.				Building a classroom and school culture of thinking is more than merely instituting a set of practices. As useful as practices like thinking routines, documentation, and effective questioning can be, culture runs deeper. Culture is built on our values and beliefs and embedded in the messages we send. Thus, deep and lasting transformation must begin by embracing a set of beliefs about teaching, learning, and schooling.In this workshop, we will explore the 10 foundational mindsets needed to create a robust culture of thinking. These mindsets motivate and guide our actions and provide the touchstones we need as we create places where thinking is valued, visible, and actively promoted. As we do so, we will look at the research behind these principles, the actions and data that can be used to move us forward in whatever teaching and learning environments we find ourselves..Participants will choose one of the 10 mindsets on which to focus for a sustained, ongoing guided inquiry, which will begin in the workshop but carry on afterwards when you return to your school.  We will use a design thinking inquiry cycle (Immersion, Ideation, Development, and Reflection) to guide us in the process. Working in small groups with others, you will identify data collection methods and specific actions you might take to move forward in your classroom. Your workshop team will become a resource and sounding board for sharing, support, and collaboration beyond the workshop.  We will have one, two hour online collaborative session after the workshop to share, discuss, and reflect on our actions (date and time to be determined).Presenter(s) Bio:Ron Ritchhart is a world- renowned educator, researcher, and author. For over 25 years, Ron served as a Senior Research Associate and Principal Investigator at Project Zero at the Harvard Graduate School of Education where his research focused on understanding how to develop, nurture, and sustain “cultures of thinking” for both students and teachers. After leaving Harvard in 2021, Ron has continued his classroom and school-based research and writing to further the ideas of visible thinking and the creation of schools as cultures of thinking. Ron’s ability to seamlessly merge theory, research, practice, and application together in a highly accessible and engaging manner has made him a best-selling author of numerous books including Intellectual Character, Making Thinking Visible, Creating Cultures of Thinking, The Power of Making Thinking Visible, and his highly anticipated new book, Cultures of Thinking in Action. Ron is a sought-after speaker for his ability to connect with and engage fellow educators in these powerful, big-picture ideas, while simultaneously providing useful insights into and practical ideas for advancing the complex world of teaching and learning. This is no doubt due to Ron’s diverse experience, which includes teaching elementary school, art, and secondary mathematics.  Upon Ron’s Harvard retirement, Howard Gardner commented, “Of all of us at Harvard Project Zero, you have had the most influence on what teachers around the world do in their classrooms and how to talk and think about it.” ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/international-school-of-amsterdam-9812017677,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cultures-of-thinking-in-action-an-inquiry-into-10-guiding-mindsets-tickets-623558569467,False,Amsterdam,False,0.9945588707923889

Employee engagement is not an HR initiative that managers are reminded to do once a year.  It is a key strategic driver of employee performance, accomplishment, and continuous improvement all year long. It is the outcome of how your organisation interacts with people to drive business results.This Employee Engagement training is suitable for anyone that works in a management or leadership role.Course Contents:Help improve the engagement of your employees and increase business successEngagement is a heightened emotional connection that an employee feels for his organisation, which influences them to put in greater effort.

It forced us to embrace technology and recalibrated our focus on educating the whole child. While the pandemic is often seen as the root cause of most of the behavior we are facing in schools today, the reality is the pandemic exacerbated and accelerated many of these challenges. From the start, the pandemic put a spotlight on many of the deep-rooted problems that educators have been quietly tackling for quite some time. While deep-rooted problems require innovative solutions, surface-level thinking often leads us towards ineffective solutions. Most approaches to behavior exhibit some good qualities, but any singular initiative is inherently flawed. There isn’t one behavior program or approach that will address all the behavior challenges in schools today.During this two-day workshop, we work together to delve into these deep-rooted problems with an appropriate depth of thinking which should yield the solutions you need to address the behavior challenges on your campus. We encourage you to join us both days but feel free to only come to the day that fits your schedule and/or interest. Please take a moment to review the descriptions of the days below so you can learn what you should expect from attending each day of the workshop.DAY 1 - HYBRID: ALTERNATIVES TO SUSPENSION AND THE ART & SCIENCE OF CHANGING BEHAVIORRestorative Practices is a new concept in schools, and like any new idea, it has faced challenges. However, replacing traditional consequences with Restorative Practices is not a realistic solution. Traditional Consequences such as suspension are used with the intention to change behavior. The challenge is in-school and out of school suspension are temporary fixes, not long-term solutions. Too often, the behavior of students doesn't improve after they return from their suspension. Whether students are suspended for one, five, or ten days, the result tends to be the same. Changing behavior requires more than just punishment. It requires intentionality, persistence, and patience. This training is designed to help participants understand how behavior changes and how they can creatively encourage positive changes in behavior. Instead of relying solely on traditional consequences such as suspension, this training will focus on how to change traditional consequences into more productive and supportive environments that create the conditions necessary to change behavior.FOCUS #1: ALTERNATIVES TO IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION (ISS)If we're being honest, in-school suspension has some benefits. By and large, most students resent being assigned in-school suspension primarily because of the social isolation. Most administrators can corroborate this from firsthand experiences of students pleading for out of school suspension instead of in-school suspension. Many students would prefer to serve their punishment at home rather than being isolated from their peers at school. The greatest flaw of ISS is that you are removing the student from the learning environment and it is relatively impossible to replicate the learning environment you are removing the student from. We convince ourselves that we are still educating these students by providing them with work from their teachers and a staff member in the room, usually a paraprofessional, to ""teach"" students as needed. In reality, the overuse of ISS serves as a temporary solution that often compounds the underlying problem which eventually creates irreparable harm to the school. We have to find alternatives that extract the benefits of ISS but also compensates where ISS is deficient.FOCUS #2: TRANSFORMING TRADITIONAL CONSEQUENCESIt’s unrealistic and counterproductive to remove traditional consequences such as in-school suspension and forms of detention from schools. The issue isn’t whether they should exist but rather how to make them effective when they are necessary. When a student’s behavior is jeopardizing the integrity of the learning environment, they need to be temporarily removed from the learning environment. With that said, removing disruptive students from the learning environment is a short-term and surface level solution that, in many cases, perpetuates deeper problems. It temporarily makes us feel comfortable that something was done to address the problem but often leads to further frustration once the students return to the learning environment. The reason why many of our disruptive students’ behavior rarely change is because we rarely work to change their behavior. We assume that the punishment alone will change their behavior but the only way to change their behavior is to identify the root causes and actively work on the behavior. Many of our current traditional consequences naturally provide the structure that is necessary to allow us to work on challenging student behavior. We simply need to reimagine how these traditional consequences should look if we want better outcomes.FOCUS #3: ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECTS”Busy Work” is one of the most counterproductive things we assign to students in education. It’s typically assigned to students with punitive intentions to pass time when a student is serving a consequence. Busy work comes in many forms such as make-up work, a written apology, or reflection sheets. For example, we place students in in-school suspension and provide them with assignments to work on from their teachers. The idea behind this is that the student will be able to keep up with the instruction that is taking place in the classrooms while they serve their punishment. But too often, that isn’t how it works. The greatest flaw of ISS is that it is virtually impossible to replicate the learning environment you are removing the student from. While well intentioned, the assigning of “busy work” in these instances doesn’t yield us the results we are looking for and, in some cases, it does more harm than good.Day 1 of the workshop will provide participants with:specific alternatives to in-school suspension that can be effective in minimizing the need for traditional in-school suspensionhow in-school suspension can be modified to minimize the amount of time a student is removed from the learning environment by strategically working to change the underlying behaviorshow to transform traditional consequences into frameworks that intentionally work to change student behavior while maintaining the structure of traditional consequenceshow to ask questions that are intuitive and encourage students to genuinely reflect about their behaviorhow to incorporate Structured Days, facilitate Restorative Circles and develop Accountability Projects that work together towards changing students' behaviorsDAY 1 - WHAT TO EXPECTDAY 2 - CREATING A RESTORATIVE PRACTICES IMPLEMENTATION PLANA school can have all of the frameworks and strategies in the world but the key to the success of any initiative will always be implementation. Having the right plan and team to execute the plan is essential. This training is designed to provide participants with specific guidance and support to help campuses develop an implementation plan specific to the needs of their campus.FOCUS #1: 3 MOST COMMON APPROACHES TO MANAGING BEHAVIOR IN SCHOOLSThroughout my tenure in education, it seems like every year there is something new that is supposed to be the answer to the challenging behaviors we face today. The only constant of these initiatives is that they're all flawed. If we're being honest, we also have to admit that they all have some good qualities too. What we've all come to understand is that there is no perfect solution that will solve the behavior challenges we face in schools today. Restorative Practices, Social Emotional Learning and Positive Behaviors Interventions and Supports can all have a positive impact on the climate and culture of your campus. With all initiatives, there will always be deficiencies. One can look to any of these frameworks and determine that they alone will not meet the diverse needs of their campus.FOCUS #2: DEFINING ROLES FOR A SUCCESSFUL RESTORATIVE PRACTICES INITIATIVEWhen implementing any initiative, it's imperative that everyone understands their role. Restorative Practices is no exception but it presents an even greater challenge because most educators struggle with how to integrate Restorative Practices into the traditional structure of a school. Because of this, most people think that you must hire additional staff to even consider implementing Restorative Practices. I think everyone would agree that adding additional staff to support any new initiative is ideal and welcomed. But if you've been in education long enough, you know that you have a better chance of winning the pick three lottery than consistently getting the staffing allocation that you need. Therefore, we have to make the best of the staffing we have and that requires being strategic and efficient. In order to be efficient, everyone must understand their roles and buy into the concept that the sum must be greater than the parts.FOCUS #3: CREATING A RESTORATIVE PRACTICES IMPLEMENTATION PLANA school can have all of the frameworks and strategies in the world but the key to the success of any behavior initiative will always be implementation. When it comes to behavior initiatives, there are commonalities from school to school as to why they ended up failing. If you want to give yourself a chance at being successful in the future, you need to start with looking at your past. Why were some of your past initiatives successful and why did some your past initiatives fail? This is a question that everyone needs to ponder before they take on what could arguably be the most challenging behavior initiative ever. What makes implementing Restorative Practices so challenging is that you are challenging a mindset that has been in place for over 100 years. To complicate things even more, Restorative Practices has a branding problem. A lot of people believe that Restorative Practices means that you are going to let students do whatever they want with no accountability. Your version of Restorative Practices can and will hold students accountable by synergizing Restorative Practices with traditional consequences. This may be your intention but it needs to be communicated through your implementation plan. Having the right plan and team to execute that plan is essential.Day 2 of the workshop will provide participants with:how to develop a campus framework that will allow you to incorporate the key elements of Restorative Practices, Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) along with traditional consequences to improve the climate and culture of the school.how to define each stakeholders' roles in order to have a successful Restorative Practices initiativehow to strategically provide leadership opportunities to all staff members to increase buy-inspecific guidance and support to help campuses develop an implementation plan specific to the needs of their campushow to create a restorative practices implementation plan that ensures the fidelity of the initiative as well as creates buy-in with the majority of the campus' stakeholdersDAY 2 - WHAT TO EXPECTABOUT THE PRESENTERKELVIN OLIVER is an Educational Consultant specializing in implementing Restorative Practices in Schools. As a campus administrator he played an instrumental role in the development, implementation, and support of Restorative Practices. Kelvin is credited for creating a Restorative Practices campus-based support model that included weekly professional development and an implementation support team. Since 2007, he has worked in education as a special education teacher, classroom teacher, campus math specialist, district curriculum specialist, assistant principal, campus principal and consultant.For more information about Kelvin’s work, please visit www.leavingthevillage.com.FAQsWhat's the cancellation/refund policy for this workshop?If you are unable to attend and need to request a refund, you must submit your refund request in writing SEVEN (7) DAYS prior to the scheduled date of the workshop. Submit all refund requests to billing@leavingthevillage.com. If you submit your refund request within  SEVEN (7) DAYS of the workshop, you can be provided with a credit that can be applied to any of our future workshops. Should I attend if I've already attended an Alternatives To Suspension and/or Guide To Implementing Restorative Practices virtual workshop series?Almost all of the strategies and concepts presented in the three virtual workshop sessions in both series will be presented again during the in-person workshops. With that said, the in-person workshops provide a greater opportunity to give more context because all of the strategies are presented in a day versus over the course of three 90-minute sessions.  The in-person workshops also provide an opportunity for hands-on learning activities that can't be duplicated virtually. The in-person workshop would be beneficial for those who have attended our virtual workshops but would like a refresher with some hands-on learning opportunities.Is this workshop beneficial for elementary educators?Our  workshops are differentiated to meet the needs of all levels, K-12. With that said, Kelvin Oliver, the presenter, was a PK-6 campus administrator when he implemented Restorative Practices on a campus. His time as a campus administrator is where he developed many of the concepts that are presented during these workshops. While the focus will be on all grade levels, elementary educators will not walk away from this workshop feeling that it didn't apply to them.Are these workshops only intended for administrators?No, you don't have to be an administrator to attend these workshops. All educators that attend these workshops will find great benefit in these workshops.Will I receive any supporting resources if I attend this workshop?Yes! At the conclusion of the workshop, each registered participant will be mailed one complimentary cheat sheet resource for each day of the workshop they registered to attend.  Each Cheat Sheet is strategically designed to support attendees of our workshops when they return back to their campus. If you register multiple participants for both days, you will receive the pair of complimentary cheat sheets for each paid registrant.When should I expect to receive the supporting resources?Participants who fulfill payment for their registration prior to the start of their scheduled workshop can expect their complimentary cheat sheets to be shipped to the shipping address provided at registration within two weeks after the conclusion of the workshop they attended. Participants who register using a purchase order as a promise of payment will need to fulfill the purchase order payment before their complimentary cheat sheets are shipped. Once the purchase order payment is fulfilled, participants can expect their complimentary cheat sheets to be shipped within two weeks of receipt of payment. Will lunch be provided either or both days?We've allotted one hour and 15-minutes for workshop attendees to have lunch on their own. Because most attendees work on a campus with students, they are rarely afforded the opportunity to go to a restaurant for lunch. Our hope is that each attendee takes advantage of this unique opportunity to enjoy a sit-down lunch like most other working professionals are able to do. Throughout both days, beverages such as coffee, water and hot tea will be available to all participants. ​Is there a room block available with a special room rate?If you need to book a hotel room, please click here or please call the hotel reservation line at 888-465-4329 and mention group code LTV and IATA # 99801505 to receive our group rate.Will I be able to receive CEU hours if I attend this workshop?Unfortunately, we can't guarantee that you will be able to receive continuing education units if you attend our workshops. We offer our workshops around the country and we are in the process of ensuring our attendees can earn credits in the future.How can I contact Leaving The Village if I have additional  questions?You can email us at info@leavingthevillage.com or call (301) 789-8407.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/leaving-the-village-30690050998,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/synergizing-restorative-practices-pbis-traditional-consequences-boston-registration-637586196477,False,Boston,False,0.9961710572242737

If This Isn't Love | Opening Reception,"September 09, 2023, 06:00 PM","September 09, 2023, 08:00 PM","74 Arlington Street, Boston, MA 02116","Brooklynn Kascel, Jackie Molloy, and Natalia Neuhaus were selected to be a part of the 2022 Leica Women Foto Project x VII Foundation Mentorship Program. 'If This Isn't Love' will explore various forms of intimacy through their respective series 'Fear and Loving', 'Love and Chaos', and 'Healers: Sex Work as a Calling'. Brooklynn Kascel | Fear and Loving Since 2017, I have photographed my queer peers in my home state of Iowa and the greater midwestern region in my ongoing series, Fear And Loving. By combining autobiographical documentary and conceptual imagery, I chronicle interpersonal queer exchanges fastened within the midwestern landscape - a place of distinct beauty, a place I love, but somewhere that is not always welcoming to all.  Using eastern Iowa as the main backdrop, these black-and-white photographs synchronously celebrate this unassuming region and recognize the harmful rhetoric toward LGBTQIA2+ people that is speckled within its geography. Fear And Loving depicts the places where we find each other to navigate the political and cultural barriers to expression and intimacy as they relate to queerness, transness and homosexual relationships. In parts of the U.S. that have not experienced cultural awakenings more common in metropolitan areas, this imagery demands the urgency for open dialogues in rural and suburban spaces about gender identity, sexual fluidity, and de-stigmatizing homosexuality as a phase. Jackie Molloy | Love and Chaos Love and Chaos is a coming-of-age documentation of the Larson quadruplets. Courtney Larson always wanted to be a mother and when told at 25 the devastating news she might not be able to conceive, she and her husband, Cameron, didn't waste time. Three rounds of fertility treatments later they found out they were pregnant with quadruplets. The babies were born premature and have worked diligently to keep up with their milestones. When I met the family in 2014 I was drawn to their openness and Courtney and Cameron's commitment to their children, making sure they had everything they needed to strive. Since then I have visited them yearly watching the children come into themselves. Their strong personalities are so different from one another but their bond to each other is seemingly everlasting. This story touches upon themes of commitment to family, raising multiples, and childhood adolescence. I plan to photograph the family until the children are at least 18 to see the trials and tribulations as well as the successes and joys they will experience. Every year I see how Ashlyn, Brody, Cooper and Kylie continue to evolve and come into their own, each so independent but also so connected to one another. Natalia Neuhaus | Healers: Sex Work as a CallingIn the past few years, I’ve become friends with women who are sex workers, and that’s how this project started. Befriending them helped me change my preconceived ideas of who a sex worker is. These friends chose this profession, as did the women photographed in this project. Many sex workers are artists whose extreme sensitivity and empathy toward others are only comparable to nurturing healers. In a world deprived of human touch and shame surrounding sex and sexuality, it’s them who provide a cure for this malady. In exchange, this profession gives them the financial stability to afford college, rent, healthcare, and the cost of living in NYC. This body of work is an homage to everyone in this profession. To those who fought and keep on fighting for decriminalization and those who constantly fear being arrested, deported, and having their children taken away from them. This constant fear and fortuitous exposure to violence is the reason why Human Rights Watch supports the full decriminalization of sex work. Since 2021, NYC became the first city in the U.S. to no longer prosecute sex work; hopefully, more will follow.ABOUT THE VII FOUNDATION For decades, on their most exacting assignments, VII photographers have relied on Leica cameras to help them challenge the status quo and change how the world is perceived.

Conquer Your Fear of Public Speaking -Chicago- Virtual Free Trial Class,"July 31, 2023, 05:00 PM","July 31, 2023, 06:30 PM","Chicago, Chicago, IL 60601","Overcome public speaking fear with gradual exposure, in a supportive environment. Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htmZenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.comOnce the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs.Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety:Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated. The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content.Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.Session Six - Respond to Questions. Open the floor to questions on a topic of choice.Session Seven - Impromptu Speaking. Learn to organize and deliver an unprepared (no notes) talk.Session Eight - Prepared Speech (Instructor Guided).

Prophetess Kisha is the author of the book “Pray That Through – A Manual on Intercession” – This book is the byproduct of many years of being trained in secret as an intercessor and successfully building and maintaining a thriving corporate prayer environment in the local church. In the first meeting, she will ""Cast Vision"" – We must understand the “Why” of the meeting as a corporate body. God has commanded her to teach, train, and activate the saints in the power of prayer and fasting; with the ability to heal the soul of man through prophetic counsel and deliverance. She believes God is moving worship and prayer back into the forefront of His Church once again, because prayer is the lifeline of the church. She believes as a Christian, we must create an appetite for prayer within our homes and in our churches. For we all know that prayer can become a dry form of ministry unless it is watered and tended in the hearts of the God’s people. This will ensure effectiveness and potency throughout the year. Every important area and activity of our life and ministry must be covered by focused prayer and we will continue to develop healthy prayer strategies that covers your life; your call, your vision; soul issues, ministry; leadership; congregational needs, community needs, and the nations & the world.Once Jesus was in a certain place praying.

The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.Zenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.com****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htmOnce the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States.

Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs.Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety:Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated. The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content.Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.Session Six - Respond to Questions. Open the floor to questions on a topic of choice.Session Seven - Impromptu Speaking. Learn to organize and deliver an unprepared (no notes) talk.Session Eight - Prepared Speech (Instructor Guided). Learn the secret of outlining and presenting a prepared speech with minimal effort or stress.Session Nine - Prepared Speech.

JonesWEBSITE | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | TWITTER  |  SPOTIFY  |  BANDCAMPOver the course of three full-length albums and two EPs, Jonathon Robert Linaberry has woven his own tapestry of American roots music. It's a classic sound for the modern world, influenced not only by blues, soul, and forward-thinking folk, but also by J.R.'s environment. From the bustle of New York City, where he launched The Bones of J.R. Jones with 2012's The Wildness, to the rustic solitude of his current home in the Catskills, J.R. has always looked to the world around him for inspiration. Few places have left him feeling as inspired as the American Southwest, an area whose desert panoramas and infinite horizons inspired the songs on his newest release, A Celebration. Written during trips to Tucson, Bisbee, Joshua Tree, and other desert destinations, the six-song EP is everything its title promises: a celebration of the thrill of getting lost in something new, whether it's a landscape, a sound, a perspective, or all of the above. ""The record's essence was shaped by those beautiful desert nights and the roads that go on endlessly,"" says J.R. A Celebration's cover art — with its western color palette, desert iconography, and black-and-white photograph of wild animals — was handmade by J.R., who also created a series of accompanying prints. A Celebration does more than shine a light on the American southwest — it highlights J.R.'s ability to the bridge the gap between artistic disciplines.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/dc9-nightclub-18157230091,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-bones-of-jr-jones-tickets-658594663367,False,DC,False,0.9948923587799072

By providing a safe environment where women can objectively see how their bodies move allows for them to focus on improving body awareness which leads to improved confidence. Body awareness is the connection between one’s mind and body. Our bodies hold on to past memories which can be a hinderance to our self improvement, especially when it comes to physical  activity.

Sex & Magic: A Dimension of Living Passionately,"September 09, 2023, 06:30 PM","September 09, 2023, 10:00 PM","Burbank Blvd, Sherman Oaks, CA 91411","T﻿HE CURRENT SITUATIONGrowing up, we got the condoms talk from our parents, the reproductive organs talk from our high school health teachers, and we received sexual performance lessons from penis-centric movies and pornos.   And with our limited sexual knowledge, we show up in the bedroom trying to create sexual magic by mimicking the spiritually-lacking sex we see on pornos, only to be disappointed when we do not get magical results.  W﻿HAT IS A SEX & MAGIC NIGHT? Sex & Magic is a safe and sexy environment for open-minded adults to tap into their sensuality through breathing, sensual dancing, intimacy exercises that include sexual engagement of the five senses, sexual education around pleasure, and an open space to ask questions about things you don't feel comfortable asking your coworkers or parents. W﻿HAT SEX & MAGIC NIGHT IS NOT?For the gutter-minded people—who I love dearly, this is not an orgy ;). We will be doing work with the body, but we will not be touching any genital areas.  Nudity is not required, but it is also not unwelcome.  The body is a beautiful piece of art and nothing to be ashamed of.   If you would like to remove articles of clothing for certain exercises, I welcome it and you will be guided through that experience.  W﻿HO IS THIS EVENT FOR?S﻿ex & Magic is for open-minded people who want to have a fun sensual explorative experience with other open-minded people. It is for people who want to have a supportive community to help with sexual growth.  It for people who feel lost in their own sexual experience.  It is for people who want a safe place to let out their sensual side without judgment.  It is for people who desire safe connection and touch.  It is for people who more tools in their sexual toolbox.  It is for people who want to try something new.  Positive vibes, a desire to learn, a desire to be open, and non judgment is a must for this setting.  If you're seeking a moment of connection and would like to dive deeper into your sexual experience in a meaningful way, this might be the perfect event for you :) D﻿RESS CODE AND ENVIRONMENTS﻿ex & Magic is built on the premise that adventure and romance should be infused into every facet of life.  The environment is always beautiful and the dress code is ""sensual and magical,"" and that is left up to the participant's interpretation.  The more fun you have with it the better, but always stay true to your own identity and comfort.  T﻿he event will be located in a private rental residence, and the exact location will be given a week before the event in the Los Angeles area.  In the spirit of not being wasteful with resources and making everything custom, I will make a final decision on the location once I have a firmer head count.  But the place will be beautiful and nicely curated.   B﻿OUNDARIEST﻿here are partner exercises and to accommodate singles, we switch partners throughout the workshop, but I send out a survey before the event to take inventory of what everyone is comfortable with.   Obviously, if you come as a couple, you are free to stay with your partner the entire time.  Nobody is required to do anything they don't want to do and because sensual energy can be so intense, there will be a designated solo area for people who might just need a moment to themselves.  Boundaries are of the utmost importance in these types of environments and we will extensively cover how to approach one another during this sensual experience.  A﻿lcohol can be your best friend or your worst enemy.  A lot of events of this nature ban alcohol because it lowers people's ability to read social cues, which is imperative in this space.  However,  for some people, having a drink or two puts them at ease in new situations so their nerves don't infringe on their ability to enjoy the experience.   If you engage in alcohol or weed, and I see it affecting your behavior, you will be asked to leave.  I would recommend coming with a clear channel, but for most adults a glass of wine or two is fine.  T﻿HE HOST WITH THE MOST J﻿asmine C. (Leyva) Perry, the host, is a veteran in the holistic space and she has done a lot of work raising awareness in the food justice space.  She is currently working on her masters in Tantra/sexology.   Her interest in the subject came because she started to experience profound confusion around her entire sexual experience, which deeply impacted her thirteen-year relationship.  Jasmine saw tons of sex scenes in movies as a teenager, but she did not have the same orgasmic experience.  She thought her vagina was broken, and she spent her next two decades dedicating her sexual experience to pleasing men instead of learning her body.  Through her tantra studies, she became more sexually liberated by learning her body, facing her sexual traumas, incorporating more intimacy into her pleasure experience and now she would like to share her exploration with others.  W﻿HAT TO BRING -﻿Please take an at-home COVID test 24 hours before the event and email or text your results to me before you arrive.

Conquer Your Fear of Public Speaking-Santa Monica-Virtual Free Trial Class,"July 31, 2023, 03:00 PM","July 31, 2023, 04:30 PM","Santa Monica, Santa Monica, CA 90401","Overcome public speaking fear with gradual exposure, in a supportive environment. Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htmZenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.comOnce the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs.Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety:Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated. The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content.Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.Session Six - Respond to Questions.

Competition, limited resources and the pressure to meet funding requirements may create a highly selective environment, making it increasingly difficult for academics to secure promotions and establish networks.  In response to these challenges, our workshop will explore the current funding landscape, and provide guidance from experienced academics who have successfully secured external funding. We also aim to build an interdisciplinary network within the academic community for future collaborations.  We will invite PhD students, early-career, mid-career and experienced researchers, funding bodies, communities and organisations interested in advancing research and knowledge exchange.

Our goal is to examine the positive and negative effects that people and industries have on natural resources in Africa and the world, and to find innovative technological solutions to mitigate these effects.Africa's natural resources, often referred to as the world's last line, are rapidly deteriorating due to careless human and business activities. Extensive analysis, samples, experiments, and measurements have demonstrated the need for change and the development of plans to reduce pollution, minimize climate impact, and ensure the provision of healthy resources for our people and the land.At Trading Green, we firmly believe that data and results from environmental studies play a crucial role in identifying and addressing various issues that can harm the environment. These issues include excessive hazardous waste, overcrowded landfills, and drastic climate change. Such ecological problems can directly impact the health and safety of people, animals, and the land itself. Through thorough soil, water, and air experiments, we gather valuable information that helps conservation engineers develop new systems to reduce or eliminate harmful contaminants that may cause illness or death.Our platform aims to utilize the insights gained from these studies to assist scientists, city planners, state and local legislators, and other engineers in designing environmentally safe procedures for construction and expansion projects. By doing so, we hope to facilitate the creation and provision of equipment and supplies for manufacturing through the collaboration of innovative technology planners. Moreover, we aim to support governments, business owners, developers, and city planners in implementing laws and regulations that protect natural resources.In collaboration with the African Property Awards and African Property Magazine, Trading Green will host its inaugural event to facilitate dialogue on the impact of businesses, governments, and all stakeholders on our ecosystem. The primary objective of this event is to explore innovative technological approaches to address these environmental challenges.With the theme ""Quality Housing,"" our event will feature the UK Environmental Minister, Thérèse Coffey, as the guest speaker. Her distinguished presence will shed light on the pressing environmental issues facing Africa today. Experts, business owners, policymakers, heads of governments, and representatives from African Governments in the UK, African Union, and African global entities will be invited to attend this significant event.The event is scheduled to take place on Saturday, November 4th at the Brent Civic Center, The Drum, Wembley Stadium, Engineers Way, London HA9 0LF.For stakeholders interested in participating, attending the event, becoming a speaker, or exploring sponsorship opportunities, please contact us at re@africahousingshow.org.Email: re@africahousingshow.orgPhone: +44 7404714332Website: www.africahousingshow.org",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/african-property-magazine-property-express-group-41561003693,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/african-housing-show-2023-tickets-670106575807,False,London,True,0.9867347478866577

Early booking is truly and highly recommended. Last time we run an event at this venue we had a larger capacity and we sold out 5 days before the event date.The reason the events we organize are so successful is that we follow a very simple, but effective formula. One week before the event we create a WhatsApp group with those attendees who wish to start getting to know each other. This allows each participant to set up meetings with those they wish to meet during (or even before) the event. On the day of the event, you will find a relaxed environment, and a welcoming and supportive crowd.Our team will be at the venue to introduce you to anybody specific you'd like to talk to.Guests will have access to the part of the Club reserved for our event, but not to other private areas of Hay Hill Club.

In this Two-day workshop-style course, attendees gain the practical tools and techniques necessary to implement the Lean Portfolio Management functions of Strategy and Investment Funding, Agile Portfolio Operations, and Lean Governance.
Participants in the course have the opportunity to capture the current and the future state of their portfolio with the Portfolio Canvas tool and identify important business initiatives for achieving the future state. Participants also explore methods to establish portfolio flow with the Portfolio Kanban and prioritize initiatives for maximum economic benefit. The course also provides insights on how to establish Value Stream Budgets and Lean Budget Guardrails and measure the Lean portfolio performance.

Why Lean Portfolio Management?
Organizations that focus on defining projects that span more than a year often get stuck in situations where teams are incentivized to meet out-of-date project goals, instead of delivering value early or seeking early feedback on market-fit. Lean portfolio management methods help organizations:

●	Shift the operations focus to delivering incremental value at shorter cadences for larger initiatives.
●	Leverage the cadences to achieve shorter feedback loops. Feedback collected via internal teams, external focus groups, customers, or end users helps measure progress towards the organization’s target outcomes.
●	Ruthlessly apply the feedback to reinvest in ideas that produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not. Produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not.

Lean Portfolio Management, informed by lean principles and built through a better understanding of customer value (and how to deliver it quickly), remedies some common pain points in large organizations.

Topics Covered

•	Introducing Lean Portfolio Management (LPM).

•	.Establishing Strategy and Investment Funding.

•	Applying Agile Portfolio Operations.

•	Applying Lean Governance Implementing the LPM function.

In this Two-day workshop-style course, attendees gain the practical tools and techniques necessary to implement the Lean Portfolio Management functions of Strategy and Investment Funding, Agile Portfolio Operations, and Lean Governance.
Participants in the course have the opportunity to capture the current and the future state of their portfolio with the Portfolio Canvas tool and identify important business initiatives for achieving the future state. Participants also explore methods to establish portfolio flow with the Portfolio Kanban and prioritize initiatives for maximum economic benefit. The course also provides insights on how to establish Value Stream Budgets and Lean Budget Guardrails and measure the Lean portfolio performance.

Why Lean Portfolio Management?
Organizations that focus on defining projects that span more than a year often get stuck in situations where teams are incentivized to meet out-of-date project goals, instead of delivering value early or seeking early feedback on market-fit. Lean portfolio management methods help organizations:

●	Shift the operations focus to delivering incremental value at shorter cadences for larger initiatives.
●	Leverage the cadences to achieve shorter feedback loops. Feedback collected via internal teams, external focus groups, customers, or end users helps measure progress towards the organization’s target outcomes.
●	Ruthlessly apply the feedback to reinvest in ideas that produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not. Produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not.

Lean Portfolio Management, informed by lean principles and built through a better understanding of customer value (and how to deliver it quickly), remedies some common pain points in large organizations.

Topics Covered

•	Introducing Lean Portfolio Management (LPM).

•	.Establishing Strategy and Investment Funding.

•	Applying Agile Portfolio Operations.

•	Applying Lean Governance Implementing the LPM function.

"Conflict Resolution / Management Training in Saint-Laurent, Quebec","August 25, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 25, 2023, 05:00 PM","Regus Bussiness Centre/Hotel, Saint-Laurent, QC H4M 2X6, Canada","Conflict management is the process of limiting the negative aspects of conflict while increasing the positive aspects of the conflict. The aim of conflict management is to enhance learning and group outcomes, including effectiveness or performance in an organizational setting.Conflict management is the process by which disputes are resolved, where negative results are minimized and positive results are prioritized. This key management skill involves using different tactics depending on the situation, negotiation, and creative thinking.Conflicts are inevitable when people with different personalities and goals are put together to work in the same environment. Quite often, the clash that results leads to extreme anger and animosity, and this can have a very disruptive effect on the entire team. As a leader, you are often called upon to defuse the situation and resolve differences in a collaborative manner, before the situation spirals out of control.Our one-day Conflict Management and Communication Skills provide you with effective tools to manage stressful situations in the workplace and become a highly successful person and leader. Learn to build conflict resolution techniques that work, and manage complex team dynamics with sensitivity and firmness.Why is conflict management important?When conflict is managed effectively, team members see conflict as a tool to exchange ideas while allowing each party to be equally heard. ""Teams cannot have effective communication without productive conflict."" Adequately managed conflict is an effective form of communication rather than a fearful argument.The conflict management process has steps such as identifying conflicts, analyzing conflict, identifying an alternative solution, applying conflict resolution techniques, choosing the best alternative, implementing the solution, and reviewing the impact.What you will learn:On completion of this course, participants will be able to:Understand why conflicts ariseIdentify common responses to conflicts in terms of behavior, thoughts, and attitudeExplore Aggressive, Passive, and Assertive approaches and the consequence of each responseHow to deal with difficult team membersLearn effective conflict resolution methods and best practices for managing conflictsHow to build trust and credibility with colleagues and team membersLearn to hold difficult conversations calmly and assertivelyCourse Agenda:The training workshop covers the following aspects:The intention behind every conflict-The cause and effect of the conflict. How did it happen? What were the consequences?Mind-set Change – Why is it important for this change? Changes are needed for progression in life. Get rid of old habits that prevent you from moving ahead. In this millennial generation, cultural differences are inherent. The steps we need to take to fit into this cultural era and adapt to the working environment and varied styles of employeesHow to apply the principles leading to conflict resolution and establish a harmonious working environmentThe 5-step strategy in implementing the blueprint for Conflict ResolutionThe areas that will be examined include:Self-Awareness and Self-ManagementBe aware of the working environment around us EmotionsHow to Manage Our Emotions BetterConflicting StylesWhy are there conflicting styles and how to manage them and collaborateConflicting RolesThe similar roles in the organization that cause conflictsConflicting ResourcesAllocation of resources that trigger conflicts and how to manage themHow to build and sustain relationships with your supervisors, colleagues, and peersThree areas to examine:Breaking Barriers to Effective Communication in a Cross-Cultural Diverse EnvironmentThe Mastery of Building Rapport in the WorkplaceBuild trust and Confidence amongst supervisors, colleagues, and peersWhy global corporates prefer Leaning Zone Inc as their Training PartnerA provider of Enterprise Learning Solutions (ELS), Learning Zone Inc creates industry-fit talents through training, coaching, and consulting by globally-acclaimed trainers.

In this Two-day workshop-style course, attendees gain the practical tools and techniques necessary to implement the Lean Portfolio Management functions of Strategy and Investment Funding, Agile Portfolio Operations, and Lean Governance.
Participants in the course have the opportunity to capture the current and the future state of their portfolio with the Portfolio Canvas tool and identify important business initiatives for achieving the future state. Participants also explore methods to establish portfolio flow with the Portfolio Kanban and prioritize initiatives for maximum economic benefit. The course also provides insights on how to establish Value Stream Budgets and Lean Budget Guardrails and measure the Lean portfolio performance.
Why Lean Portfolio Management?
Organizations that focus on defining projects that span more than a year often get stuck in situations where teams are incentivized to meet out-of-date project goals, instead of delivering value early or seeking early feedback on market-fit. Lean portfolio management methods help organizations:
● Shift the operations focus to delivering incremental value at shorter cadences for larger initiatives.
● Leverage the cadences to achieve shorter feedback loops. Feedback collected via internal teams, external focus groups, customers, or end users helps measure progress towards the organization’s target outcomes.
● Ruthlessly apply the feedback to reinvest in ideas that produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not. Produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not.
Lean Portfolio Management, informed by lean principles and built through a better understanding of customer value (and how to deliver it quickly), remedies some common pain points in large organizations.
Topics Covered
• Introducing Lean Portfolio Management (LPM).
• .Establishing Strategy and Investment Funding.
• Applying Agile Portfolio Operations.
• Applying Lean Governance Implementing the LPM function.

In this Catholic burial ground, all sorts of atrocities occurred. Doctors autopsied bodies out in the open. Priests advised pregnant women to receive the horrible “infant baptism” operation. People were buried alive.Today, the old cemetery is hidden just underneath two of Montreal’s most stunning and popular urban parks - Dorchester Square and Place du Canada.

Ghost-hunting tools such as Dowsing Rods, EMF Readers, Temperatures Guns and other devices will be made available to reach out to the many deranged spirits that haunt the Old Sainte Antoine Cholera Cemetery.Not only will guests learn about the cemetery’s ghosts and paranormal activities, but also a haunted statue and the haunted buildings that surround the cemetery’s urban environment, such as the Sun Life Building, Old Windsor Hotel, Chateau Champlain Hotel, St George’s Anglican Church and Marie-Reine-du Monde Cathedral and Basilica.This otherworldly experience is designed for those interested in the paranormal and ghost-hunting, as seen on television programs like Rencontres Paranormales, Most Haunted, TAPS’ Ghost Hunters and many others.

Teamwork Skills: Communicating Effectively in Groups Training in Montreal,"August 24, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 24, 2023, 05:00 PM","PH: +1 469 666 9332, Montreal, QC H3A 2A6, Canada","Certificate: Course Completion Certificate						Language: EnglishDuration: 1 Day																						  Credits: 8Course Delivery: Classroom/ Virtual Live/ On-SiteCourse Overview:Effective teamwork and group communication are essential for your professional and personal success. In this course you will learn to: make better decisions, be more creative and innovative, manage conflict and work with difficult group members, negotiate for preferred outcomes, improve group communication in virtual environments, develop a better overall understanding of human interaction, and work more effectively as a team. Our goal is to help you understand these important dynamics of group communication and learn how to put them into practice to improve your overall teamwork.Course Contents:Module 1Module 1 is all about communication. But not the common sense or taken-for-granted notions of communication you might expect. Instead, we’re going to rethink communication and challenge some of the conventional wisdom about communication that is common in our society. We’ll compare and contrast different theories or models of communication, and see if we can develop a more sophisticated understanding of communication to understand the complexities of human interaction in today’s groups. We’ll also explore some of the hidden forces of group communication, like context, systems and institutions, and design. These are all things that are “present” in any group situation, influencing how we interact with each other, but easy to miss if we’re not looking. We want to expand our field of vision, so to speak, so we have a fuller understanding of what’s happening in any group situation.Module 2Module 2 focuses on group development and decision making. We’ll look at how groups come together through socialization, how they develop norms, and how roles emerge. And we’ll compare and contrast different models that explain these processes. We’ll examine the various decision making traps that groups can fall into, while also developing better practices for making good group decisions. And we’ll explore how groups can be more creative and innovative in their decision making.Module 3Module 3 is all about conflict, difference, and diversity. We’ll learn how groups can have a good fight and how you can choose the right words in a dispute…as well as how to negotiate with others when things get difficult. We’ll also explore why difference and diversity are so important for group communication, and how understanding the concept of identity is critical for our involvement in groups. And we’ll pay special attention to communication and gender, one of the most significant aspects of difference and diversity for groups to understand.Module 4Module 4 covers group communication and technology…an increasingly prevalent aspect of the modern landscape of group work we must understand. We’ll look at the concept of virtual work and how groups are using technology, as well as various models and theories of media functionality and information processing. We’ll cover several practical and conceptual issues we should always keep in mind when it comes to technology and group communication, and we’ll explore some cutting-edge thinking about technology and group work through the fascinating theory of sociomateriality.Course Feature:At the end of this stress management training you will be able to:Understand the complexities of human interaction in today’s groups.Examine the various decision-making traps that groups can fall into, while also developing better practices for making good group decisions.Special attention to communication and gender is one of the most significant aspects of difference and diversity for groups to understand.How to negotiate with others when things get difficult.Learn how groups can have a good fight and how you can choose the right words in a dispute.We’ll cover several practical and conceptual issues we should always keep in mind when it comes to technology and group communication.Note:However, catering to the demands of busy professionals, our virtual training programs are as effective as face-to-face learning.

Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htmZenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.comOnce the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs.Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety:Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated.

In this six-week course you will learn to recognize assailant ploys and manipulations and how to thwart them. Practice releases from common grabs and decisive strikes to vital targets. Use your voice and body language with impact. Recognize the signs that will let you defuse, de-escalate or evade before a physical assault ever happens. Assess your risks, and plan around them. Understand the connections between awareness, threats, and our media environment. The six sessions give you time between classes to practice your moves and become more comfortable with them.This is a progressive skill-building course. You will learn the most basic elements early on, and practice them in later drills. The first sessions will focus more on physical skills: strikes to vulnerable targets, releases from grabs, body language, and using your voice. Later sessions will put your new skills in various contexts, look more at setting boundaries, and different verbal strategies to control uncomfortable situations. Finally, you will learn to recognize domestic violence, and how to get help if you (or someone you know) are in an abusive relationship.There will be review in each class. There is also some extra enrichment activities (some call it “homework”).

The aim of conflict management is to enhance learning and group outcomes, including effectiveness or performance in an organizational setting.Conflict management is the process by which disputes are resolved, where negative results are minimized and positive results are prioritized. This key management skill involves using different tactics depending on the situation, negotiation, and creative thinking.Conflicts are inevitable when people with different personalities and goals are put together to work in the same environment. Quite often, the clash that results leads to extreme anger and animosity, and this can have a very disruptive effect on the entire team. As a leader, you are often called upon to defuse the situation and resolve differences in a collaborative manner, before the situation spirals out of control.Our one-day Conflict Management and Communication Skills provide you with effective tools to manage stressful situations in the workplace and become a highly successful person and leader. Learn to build conflict resolution techniques that work, and manage complex team dynamics with sensitivity and firmness.Why is conflict management important?When conflict is managed effectively, team members see conflict as a tool to exchange ideas while allowing each party to be equally heard. ""Teams cannot have effective communication without productive conflict.""

Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htmZenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.comOnce the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students.

The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness.

You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.Session Six - Respond to Questions.

Conquer Your Fear of Public Speaking - San Fran - Virtual Free Trial Class,"July 31, 2023, 03:00 PM","July 31, 2023, 04:00 PM","San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94016","Overcome public speaking fear with gradual exposure, in a supportive environment. Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htmZenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.comOnce the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness.

The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content.Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.Session Six - Respond to Questions.

Enjoy each other's touch. You can come and enjoy giving and receiving caring touch from other people who want to give and receive it. 2. Practice Consent. A major part of Cuddle Parties is learning how to ask for what you want and how to answer requests. Worried? Confused? Don't fret - we will teach, guide and help you practice how to do it. Why is Cuddling important?Nurturing and consensual loving touch is good for maintaining a healthy life, a strong nervous system and a balanced emotional state for people of all walks of life. One’s ability to connect with and develop greater trust in others is emphasized during the group exchanges during Cuddle Parties. Self-care is a cornerstone of the Cuddle Party experience.Is this SEX?!Great question! No. This is a non-sexual event. You have the option of experiencing touch and maybe intimacy if you'd like to - but we steer away from sexual behavior. If you are looking for something sexy, we're all for it! :) just not in this event.You can find more info about Cuddle Parties after the logistical information below.Some Frequently Asked Questions regarding COVID-19:Will EVERYONE be fully vaccinated?YES!

People are encouraged to engage in communication and touch, in a non-threatening, share-affirming environment. Cuddle Party is a holistic, social environment, that attracts fascinating people from all walks of life. It provides a special and unique opportunity for connection, learning and growth. Cuddle Party experiences teach participants that they alone (with the staff's assistance) create their own safety container. How does it change people's lives? Many of us have a hard time saying NO to requests, and saying no might make us feel afraid that we will hurt the other person. Very rarely do we get a chance to practice saying NO, or practice getting a NO in a safe and nurturing environment. But it's not all about the NO, it's also about the YES! We practice saying YES to one another, and asking for what we want, and changing our minds - all very important skills that we don't put an emphasis on in our everyday lives. It's transformative for people!For more information go to http://www.cuddleparty.com/faq/ If you have any other questions feel free to contact us at info@sfcuddles.com Come meet open and fun loving people and cuddle with us!",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/yoni-alkan-12634630621,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sf-cuddles-cuddle-party-at-heartlab-saturday-sept-9th-2023-tickets-665746183757,False,SF,False,0.996637225151062

Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htmZenspeak Public Speaking Center: https://www.speakeeezi.comOnce the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness.

You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.Session Six - Respond to Questions.

For 30-40 minutes, Nathaniel and/or Julian will guide you through a simple breathing technique accompanied by music and prompts.Activating the power of your own breath, your body can naturally shed layers of stress, anxiety, self-doubt, and stuck emotions, and then settle into a place of inner stillness and intuitive insight.Writing prompts will be offered prior to breathwork to intentionally deepen the healing experience.We believe everyone is a student, and everyone is a teacher. Whether you are new to breathwork, or experienced, our facilitation style is a match for all levels. You’ll discover new ways of relating to yourself and the world around you as you cultivate a deeper sense of inner peace and well-being.Bring: A journal and a body free of substances. Also bring an eye mask and light blanket if you have them. For a deeper experience, we recommend not having a heavy meal within 2 hours before we start.Bio: A queer couple, Nathaniel and Julian combine their complementary expertise and passion to create unique self-healing experiences. Breathwork has been a major practice in their healing journey both individually and as a couple. So much so that they completed 5 levels of training with renowned healer David Elliott.They’re the stewards of Spirit Camp, a magical retreat sanctuary located in the coastal redwoods of Mendocino, California, dedicated to providing greater access to a range of healing modalities. Spirit Camp aims to create a safe and nurturing environment for people to connect with their authentic selves, explore their spirituality, and self-heal from past traumas.Forever curious in their desire to grow into their most authentic, whole selves, Nathaniel and Julian explore a wide range of healing practices that they weave into their work. Having experienced the dogmatic structures of patriarchal systems, they continually work to identify these tendencies within themselves as they strive to hold space for self-healing where everyone is empowered to follow their inner guidance.Schedule & Late Policy: *Doors close at 11:05am. Please arrive on time as we will not be able to let people in late once we begin*Terms & Conditions:As breathwork can be physically and emotionally activating, it is contraindicated for those who have severe hypertension, cardiovascular disease, asthma, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, recent acute trauma, heavy medications, family history of aneurysm, or any recent major surgeries.

Enjoy each other's touch. You can come and enjoy giving and receiving caring touch from other people who want to give and receive it. 2. Practice Consent. A major part of Cuddle Parties is learning how to ask for what you want and how to answer requests. Worried? Confused? Don't fret - we will teach, guide and help you practice how to do it. Why is Cuddling important?Nurturing and consensual loving touch is good for maintaining a healthy life, a strong nervous system and a balanced emotional state for people of all walks of life. One’s ability to connect with and develop greater trust in others is emphasized during the group exchanges during Cuddle Parties. Self-care is a cornerstone of the Cuddle Party experience.Is this SEX?!Great question! No. This is a non-sexual event. You have the option of experiencing touch and maybe intimacy if you'd like to - but we steer away from sexual behavior. If you are looking for something sexy, we're all for it! :) just not in this event.You can find more info about Cuddle Parties after the logistical information below.Some Frequently Asked Questions regarding COVID-19:Will EVERYONE be fully vaccinated?YES!

Very rarely do we get a chance to practice saying NO, or practice getting a NO in a safe and nurturing environment. But it's not all about the NO, it's also about the YES! We practice saying YES to one another, and asking for what we want, and changing our minds - all very important skills that we don't put an emphasis on in our everyday lives. It's transformative for people!For more information go to http://www.cuddleparty.com/faq/ If you have any other questions feel free to contact us at info@sfcuddles.com Come meet open and fun loving people and cuddle with us!",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/yoni-alkan-12634630621,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sf-cuddles-cuddle-party-at-heartlab-sunday-aug-20th-2023-tickets-665737287147,False,SF,False,0.9966222047805786

Ultimately, the success of an investment plan is not dependent on just the performance of the investment but also on the behaviour of the investor.Women can make good investors but they need to play to their strengths and when needed, get good help. Hence, I hope to help women who are new to investing or have just started exploring DIY investment platforms to kickstart their investment journey through this workshop.This workshop is designed to with beginners in mind to guide them through concepts and strategies.About Lee MengLee Meng, Executive Financial Services Consultant, is a certified Chartered Financial Practitioner with a primary focus of using the “Building Transferable Wealth” concept in solving the financial issues for her personal clients.She also specializes in helping companies formulate a proper plan to integrate employee benefits into their culture.Find out more about Lee Meng at https://www.gen.com.sg/leemeng",https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/lee-meng-50907262723,https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/money-management-for-women-workshop-discover-your-money-personality-tickets-687764420897,False,Singapore,False,0.9953169822692871

Once we bring them out in to the light or show them they're not alone, they'll feel like we can work with them better.Week 3: Flow, Energy + Motivation - learn about all the different ways people get things done (not just the way society tells you you need to be in order to be 'productive' and 'successful'. Explore new rituals, systems, ways of thinking that work best for you.Week 4: Money + Pricing - there had to be a week about money because bills need to be paid and we need to live and eat! Explore how you set prices, how you manage cash flow, how you think about what we need to normalise about money in self employment, and why earning 'what' matters to you.Week 5: Selling as You, for Who? - get clear on who you want to be selling to. Get happy with your own unique sell style. Figure out what kind of person would want to buy from YOU because they want to work with YOU. Discuss how you're currently reaching them and how you might be able to reach even more of them, even more effectively.Week 6: Rewiring your beliefs about how work works - take stock together on what insights you've learnt that are most important to you. Make note of the tools, reframes, perspectives and ideas that have challenged you in the best way for you to move forwards in your work and business. Leave with both a plan, and a deeper sense of confidence + self-trust in how you can create your own version of success.I﻿'m excited! Are you?FORMATOver the 6 week period we will create a container together that is confidential and non-judgemental. We will all be entering the space from different perspectives as unique individuals with various business types, set-ups and experiences, so an open ear, and open heart, and respect for others is mandatory. Each person will share only what they wish to share. Through shared vulnerability and a commitment to each other, we’ll create group trust so it will feel safe to go deeper into our experiences, lessen the grip of insecurities and struggles that block us from experiencing the work and life we want, and find new or renewed confidence and belief in ourselves so that we can unstick, and make things happen in our businesses.I will take you through group exercises and inquiries drawn from various coaching methods and 10 years of business/brand strategy experience. I will facilitate self-enquiry, group thinking, perspective shifts, exposure to other business strategies and models, and collective conversation. Whilst I will be offering a range of frameworks or exercises, I will be coaching you, not mentoring you (i.e. I won't be telling you what to do or telling you to follow set models). This programme very much focuses on reconnecting you to your own resourcefulness and answers, and tapping in to the collective knowledge and experience of the live group. There is no singular correct way to do self employment or run a business, and we will all have learnt and be learning different things along the way. The learnings that we will all share, will feed in to a melting pot of experiences, inspirations and ideas that will create a learning experience bigger than the sum of it's parts. It will also create a sense of not being alone in how you feel, as well as offering community and support in your journey and ambitions. DATES, TIMES & LOCATIONWednesdays over 6 weeks 10:30am - 12:00pm (NL Time) 13th, 20th, 27th September; 4th, 11th, 18th October 2023Stories, Sarphatistraat 14, Amsterdam (tea, coffee and mini stroopwaffels included)(You're welcome to arrive at the practice to settle in up to 15 minutes before we begin. To ensure a safe space with no disruptions, late entry will not be possible).IS THIS FOR YOU?The programme will be in English - people of all nationalities and backgrounds are welcome.This programme is for people who have already set up as a self employed person or small business owner and have the wheels already in motion. It is not for people who would like to become self employed, or people running large businesses. I heartily welcome a range of industries and professions, as well as a range of self employment experience, e.g. from having completed your first 6-12 months in business, to being 5 years in and feeling lost or wondering where you go from here. Please do drop me an email on hannah@takecoachingamsterdam.nl if you are unsure if it's for you and would like to ask any questions!T﻿he most important factor, is that you want to be here. You are willing to show up, be part of and contribute to the group experience, and open yourself to the wonderful uncertainty of what will be discovered and unfold.Although this programme will, at times, feel therapeutic, holistic and personal, it is not therapy. Whilst we set up a container that enables trust and honesty, we ask everyone to take responsibility for their experience. Please speak to your therapist if you are wondering whether it is right for you to take this course.TICKETS 500€ + 21% BTW for the 6 week programmeIf you'd like an invoice so that you can reclaim the 21 % BTW, contact me on hannah@takecoachingamsterdam.nl with your KVK and BTW details.Y﻿OUR FACILITATOR AND COACHH﻿annah Ray is a therapeutic business, career and life coach. After working as a strategist in the advertising industry for over 10 years, she decided to put her skills more in to people than ads, retrained as a coach and founded and grew her own coaching practice, TAKE. She has so far coached a huge variety of people with different work set ups, from PR consultants, a dog groomer with their own salon, a swimwear designer, padel club creators, boutique hotel owners, to audiobook producers, filmmakers, sustainability experts, CFOs and COOs of start ups, and more. H﻿er approach to coaching is in the belief that the person sitting in front of her is fully capable and much more resourceful than they think. She is not interested in telling you what to do, but in finding out what the right questions to ask you are, so that you can bring some tenderness to your blocks and doubts, allow yourself to dream and voice your ideas + ambitions, and then explore what kind of set ups or ways of working will enable you to make shit happen. As much as she works holistically, spaciously and with a considered manner, she is deeply practical and will lovingly challenge you to create your own plan of action that moves you back in to alignment and keep stepping in the direction you want to go.H﻿annah has extensive experience with running groups and workshops for the most garrulous of crowds in corporate settings, as well as patience, respect and space for the quietest of introverts and dancing creative brains. She is also a 450hr yoga therapist with a lot of experience guiding group energy and inquiry in both a studio and 1-1 setting.w﻿ww.takecoachingamsterdam.nl",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/take-life-coaching-amsterdam-hannah-ray-66019281513,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/im-my-own-boss-club-group-coaching-for-self-employed-small-biz-owners-tickets-660356723737,False,Amsterdam,False,0.9875613451004028

Letting go of perfectionism: High Performing WomenClass/Online/ Providence,"August 21, 2023, 07:00 PM","August 21, 2023, 08:00 PM","Providence, Providence, RI 02860","In my many years working with high-performing women, I've noticed limiting patterns affecting performance and overall wellness. Some include a lack of self-confidence (e.g., impostor syndrome), putting other people's needs first, perfectionism, and burnout.Some of these limitations are rooted in the context in which we live. For example, women are constantly expected to meet society's conflicting demands: be extraordinary, practice self-care, spend quality time with family, and be good caregivers. How can you feel good enough in an environment demanding more and more?In this 1-hour master class, we will explore perfectionism and identify the keys to overcoming it. Perfectionism is the tendency to consider anything less than perfect as unacceptable. If not managed, it may produce: procrastination, high-stress levels, conflict in relationships, controlling behaviors, fear of failure, and lower performance (paradoxically.)By the end of this program, you will better understand how perfectionism impacts your life and obtain tools to overcome it. You will leave feeling empowered to pursue your goals with greater self-awareness and self-compassion.Before the event, you will receive a Zoom invitation. CLASS CONTENTSDifference between perfectionism and having high standards. Impact of this pattern on personal life, relationships, and work. Perfectionism development theories. Five keys to managing perfectionism. ABOUT MEMy name is Rodolfo Alvarez.

Druker Company President Ronald M. Druker will give welcoming remarks.More about David P. Manfredi, FAIA, LEED AP:David Manfredi works with clients across the country on a diverse portfolio of planning and design projects. Deeply committed to the belief that the quality of our environment directly influences the quality of our lives, he effectively advocates for building and protecting vital, sustainable, durable urban places. At every scale, in every context, David's mission is to create common ground that brings people and communities together. He reinvents tired urban precincts into 21st-century mixed-use environments, the edges of universities from barriers into connective seams with adjacent neighborhoods, underutilized urban areas into diverse innovation districts that support the collaborative imperatives of today's science and technology, and obsolete manufacturing buildings into repurposed hubs of living and working that reinvigorate the urban core. The portfolio of design work is diverse in typology and scale and similar in sense of purpose and commitment to values of sustainability, diversity and inclusion. This diversity of work and commitment to values is manifest in the planning for Boston Landing and the architecture of New Balance headquarters, Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics practice facilities and the Track at New Balance; the mixed-use towers of Seaport Square; the research headquarters for Vertex Pharmaceuticals; the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard; the research headquarters for MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX; the Seaport headquarters for Mass Mutual; the rehabilitations of the Cathedral of the Holy Cross; the former Sears building at 401 Park Drive; and the planning for the Volpe Redevelopment Parcel at MIT. A compelling, sought-after speaker and thought-leader, David presents to business, civic, and professional organizations throughout the country about the value that mindful design brings to the quality of everyday life.David is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects and an active member of the Boston Preservation Alliance, Boston Society of Architects, and Urban Land Institute (ULI). He serves on the Boston Civic Design Commission, as chair of the University of Notre Dame School of Architecture Advisory Council, on the Board of Trustees of the Boston Architectural College, the Boston Society of Architects Foundation and the ULI Boston Advisory Board. David is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame with Bachelor degrees in both English and Architecture, and the University of Chicago, where he received a Master of Arts.David has been recognized by A Better City with the Norman B.

A first generation wealth builder is usually building from ground zero: zero inheritance in financial assets, a portfolio of liabilities and a $0 or negative net worthSecond Generation Wealth Builders (SGWBs) -- 20%A second generation wealth builder, typically is an individual who is one of the few in their family to think about and/or continue the process of building generational wealth. Second generation wealth builders (SGWBs) usually have some financial inheritance or some type of inherited assets from the first generation wealth builder(s) in their family but don’t know how to manage, sustain or grow their inheritance and are looking to learn what their options are and best principles and practices to minimize risks in investing and maximize the use of their current resources while doing so. However, unlike a first generation wealth builder, a second generation wealth builder does not start at ground zero; second generation wealth builders typically start with some inheritance in financial assets, maybe a portfolio of assets and liabilities and a positive net worth, which can range anywhere from $100K - $500K to a multi-millionaire.NuancesFirst generation wealth builders generally are living a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle and/or have no passive income streams with a $0 and negative net worth. However, some first generation wealth builders can have a positive net worth, those usually from their own hard work and no inheritance. Second generation wealth builders, though they have inherited one or more financial assets with a high-level net worth can be living paycheck to paycheck or have a cushion, but typically do not know how to maintain, invest and grow the wealth and assets inherited.Third Generation Wealth Builders and Multi-Generational Wealth Builders --10%These individuals usually have some financial inheritance or some type of inherited assets but don't know how to manage, sustain or grow their inheritance and are looking to learn how to do so.You should join our community if you want to...Learn the basics...✅ change your mindset and knowledge on money to learn accurate and correct financial information to become financially literate (Stage 1)✅ create a financial plan to undo financial damage and  start repairing a solid financial foundation to build on (Stage 2)✅ save and manage money well (Stage 2)✅ explore short-term and long-term investing opportunities / best practices for investing (Stage 2)and learn what the top 1% are doing (advanced finance, business and investing education and opportunities)...✅ own, build and sustain successful online and/or brick-and-mortar businesses from idea to planning to funding and capital to management and sustainability to a full-time income (Stage 3)✅ learn the tax code / best tax practices to keep more of your hard earned money in your pocket / in your family for no matter what you are at in your journey (Stages 2-5)✅ explore and invest in different types of traditional and non-traditional investing opportunities / pros and cons: real estate, stocks, bonds, crypto, nfts, etc. (Stage 4)✅ learn the best ways / explore best practices to grow and protect your financial assets and portfolio (Stages 2-5)AND don't just learn these, but get matched to one or more mentors in our network to work with you at every stages DURING the bootcamp AND AFTER the bootcamp ends so that you can continue to make progress on your journey to building individual and generational wealth.Generational Wealth BootcampRegister for our next generational wealth bootcamp in a city near you!

Many pastors and church staff are not trained in this area. Struggling finances equals weakened or diluted mission and stinted vision fulfillment. Struggling finances doesn’t only mean diluted mission and vision, it can also bring with it a degree of exhaustion for the Pastor and the Board as they try to navigate financial leadership.The Bible has enough to say about the importance of generosity and its impact on our spiritual health that financial matters deserve a role in your discipleship strategy.

His music draws upon a number of genres, with elements of ambient, folk, and occasional loose rock, offering a captivating intimacy while developing in a richer palette of emotions. Fatato’s voice lends itself to a tender and fractured characteristic that makes it vulnerably enchanting.In his compositions, there is a considered effort to find light within all things, as though a widened view on the possibility of strength, wonder and joy might allow more opportunities for these features to be revealed.Fatato tours nationally and has released 5 albums as a leader: “Difficult Freedom”, “EP1”, “Wonderland”, and “Settle Down”.Alex Fatato, guitar & vocals Adam Berkowitz, drumsMijael Maratuech, bassMolly Pope, guitarFollow ALEX FATATO----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPOKEN WORD ARTIST:JEN LEWIS- Poetry -Jen Lewis wanted to be a writer on and off since childhood.

Aaron's passion and love of hockey came to what he thought would be an abrupt halt in 2005, but his determination continued, ultimately leading him to a 5-year career playing professional hockey. His journeys and successes wouldn't have been possible without the extremely powerful visualization practice he developed. Aaron has a truly inspiring story of overcoming a tremendous amount of adversity. His hockey career, post-secondary studies, and personal experiences led Aaron to develop his unique practice. Today, he is dedicated to teaching others how to find their true grit through visualization. S﻿pecial thanks to our PWBC Phoenix Diamond PartnersM﻿edstar Health & D.C.

How to Turn Your Journal Into a Self-Empowerment Tool - Alexandria,"August 06, 2023, 12:00 PM","August 06, 2023, 01:00 PM","Virtual via Zoom, Alexandria, VA 22206","This workshop will be held live on Zoom.In just one hour, you’ll learn a simple journaling technique that will reconnect you to yourself and others. All that's required is an open mind and a willingness to be compassionate and supportive. Plan for 60 minutes on Sunday, from 12:00-1:00 PM EASTERN.This workshop is for you if: You're naturally everyone else's biggest cheerleader, and you're ready to prioritize being your own.  You need to remember how to make time for yourself. And you've grown accustomed to being on auto-pilot as you tend to the needs of everyone around you.  You're looking for a process that will guide you into a sustainable journaling practice that celebrates you. You're looking for a supportive community that will celebrate your wins alongside you and motivates you to keep going. If you’re tired of feeling disconnected, then this completely FREE workshop is for you. I’ve designed it to help people like you celebrate themselves, connect with like-minded people, and (finally!) start their journaling journey. Because let's face it. You've exceeded goals and met deadlines set by other people, all while sensing that something's missing. This sense is your desire knocking on the door.

"On the Front Lines of Race, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (REDI)","August 17, 2023, 01:00 PM","August 17, 2023, 04:00 PM","1505 Eutaw Place, Baltimore, MD 21217","On the Front Lines of Race, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (REDI)Disrupting practices and policies that reinforce the power of isms is not for the faint of heart. The philanthropic and business communities are targeting resources in the name of creating equity and improving outcomes for all groups. From corporations and nonprofits to universities and government agencies, many entities have constructed outward-facing equity statements and have directed management to lead the charge of achieving equity. However, frustration remains for those who are on the front lines working to disrupt and dismantle inequities within public health, education, housing, and workforce systems. To this end, Iona Concepts, Inc. has created a menu of Transformational Learning Circles. These sessions are designed to incorporate the voices of those who are at the forefront of this work and responsible for creating and implementing practices that move the needle of change toward progress. These collaborative convenings are iterative and build on the collective experiences of our Brain Trust, a cadre of seasoned practitioners who center liberatory practices and have a track record of executing models that are disrupting structural inequities and violence in organizational systems and communities. Transformational Learning Circles are curated for participants who aim to learn about and achieve sustainable and transferable practices that advance racial justice and healing inside and outside organizational systems and communities. Sessions are held at Baltimore Unity Hall 1505 Eutaw Place, Baltimore, MD 21217 at no cost, yet monetary donations are welcomed. We encourage Baltimore City’s social and public health organizations, social entrepreneurs,  educators, students, and researchers to join us. At the completion of each circle, p﻿articipants will receive a certificate of completion. For registration, we require the completion of this surveyT﻿o get in contact with our team, please reach us at: admin@livewellbemore.comTransformational Learning CirclesConducting Race Equity Audits and BenchmarksThursday, 5/22/23, 1 - 4 pm (date change from original 5/18/22)Funders are tying strings to connect resources by requesting that providers create equity strategies and benchmarks. This process begins with auditing policies, practices, and operational systems. Collecting information for analysis requires a multi-prong approach of reviewing pre-existing data, including the origin story of the institution, human resources data, and conducting key informant surveys and interviews.  This session will explore how this process can create organizational “white water” by triggering racial trauma for people of color and uncovering unconscious biases of supervisors and co-workers. Participants will learn:- Key indicators to facilitate an analysis that focuses on measuring the impact of REDI audits and benchmarking - Learn key strategies to navigate the turbulence of uncovering disparities that are often baked into organizational cultureWhen Race, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (REDI) Create PTSDThursday, 6/15/23, 1- 4 pmPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a hidden condition that can be triggered by ongoing experiences with microaggression, discrimination, and retaliation for speaking up and out about inequitable policies, practices, and culture that undermines people who experience discrimination due to class, disability, educational/employment status, ethnicity, gender expression or identity, national origin, race and sexual orientation individually or with intersectionality. This condition can also be triggered when frontline REDI practitioners constantly experience covert, uninformed, and performative efforts without a real destination or plan of action.  This session will explore how Courageous Conversations designed to uncover workplace biases are often fatiguing and can trigger workplace PTSD. Participants will learn how to recognize the conditions of a toxic work environment and learn strategies to support and implement mindfulness within organizational operating norms.Healing the DEI OfficersThursday, 7/20/23, 1-4 pmFacilitating Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives should/must confront the history and apparatus of racism. DEI practitioners’ bodies become the container for the resistance of shifting power dynamics.  The DEI arena consists of practitioners who were promoted to often ambiguous positions without the benefit of committed leadership and the authority to move the needle of racial equity in policy and practice. This session will explore the restraining forces that take a toll on the economic, emotional, mental well-being of practitioners, and ultimately resulting in physical health challenges and a diminished quality of work life.  Participants will share strategies to cope in toxic environments and will learn ways to leverage healing technologies in the moment to develop a practice of self-care in the workplace.Interior Design Principles for Trauma-Exposed PublicsThursday, 8/17/23, 1-4 pmThe work environment can promote productivity and a healing space for those who work in trauma-exposed environments. Often, social health practitioners are exposed to vicarious trauma as a result of working with community members who are experiencing chronic and compound stress. The interior composition of a client serving environment can further induce toxic stress. This session will explore how the positioning of furniture in the workplace, color pallets, art, lighting, plants, sound and ergonomics can reduce stress for both provider and client. Participants will learn trauma informed design principles that promote wellness and biophilia in the workplace.Collaboration over CompetitionThursday, 9/21/23, 1-4 pmCapitalism is baked into institutions’ operating norms.  Disrupting Eurocentric ethos of rugged individualism, scarcity and competitiveness in the Black social uplift space is important to our collective movement and sustainability. Dismantling social determinants of health will require the disruption of silos that further reinforce competition over collective impact and outcomes.   To embrace the principles of Ubuntu (I am because we are) is to begin to unlearn the principles of bootstrapping.  Participants will learn how to incorporate the principles of Ubuntu, create and deepen partnerships and collaborations, and identify tools to interact with those who have not embraced the principles of Ubuntu.Dismantling the Myth of White Supremacy at WorkThursday, 10/19/23, 1-4 pmThe Myth of White Supremacy is centered in every aspect of workplace culture, interpersonally and structurally. It is not just the water in which we all exist; it is an anti-oppressive decision point that one ultimately decides to make or not to make. Dismantling the myth of white supremacy in work environments requires individuals, communities, and organizations to understand the stakes and range of possibilities of either choice. This session will explore the tactics used to promote the myth of white supremacy culture, including supervisory styles, communication practices, competitive environments, and performance reviews.  Participants will engage in experiential processes that uncover the operating norms, as well as, uncover strategies to dismantle operational practices, policies, and procedures that reinforce and burden internal and external stakeholders. Facilitating Data-Driven REDIThursday, 11/16/23, 1-3 pm With a standard in place that defines and identifies what it means to be diverse, equitable and inclusive it becomes possible to measure diversity, equity and inclusion in a company, understand that company’s “level” of diversity, equity and inclusion against the standard and drive measurable and methodical results - i.e. make the company more diverse, equitable and inclusive over time. This requires data skills on the part of the facilitator and leaders in the company. This session will introduce participants to a new measurement system and tool for diversity, equity and inclusion, and methods for understanding decision funnels in companies that can be analyzed and utilized to drive improvements.These sessions are in part sponsored by Innovation Works.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-living-well-center-17608036459,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/on-the-front-lines-of-race-equity-diversity-and-inclusion-redi-tickets-541527321797,False,DC,False,0.9934231638908386

BE BOLD. BE BRILLIANT. BE BADASS.  BE BETTER,"November 06, 2023, 08:00 AM","November 06, 2023, 05:00 PM","4200 Connecticut Avenue NW Theater for the Arts, Washington, DC 20008","TEDxUStreetWomen is a local, independently organized event to be held in Washington DC. We want this to be an event that strives to recreate the unique experience found at TED, where the world’s leading thinkers and doers congregate to share what they are most passionate about. At its core, the fundamental goal of TED and TEDxUStreetWomen is to foster and spread great ideas while celebrating Washington DC and the U Street Corridor community.  			Bold + Brilliant = Badass is our Mantra! What do we mean when we say, Bold + Brilliant =  Badass?  To be Bold, means you are willing to speak out for the issues that mean the most to you.  To be Brilliant, means you have the experience, knowledge, and passion needed to advocate for your idea. When you combine Bold + Brilliant, the results is a Badass. Being a Badass means that, despite your fear, any potential backlash/criticism, or how unpopular your idea maybe to some, you will still push forward to share your truth.   														  BE BOLD.   BE BRILLIANT.   BE BADASS.
  BE BETTER 
 We've all heard the saying - do better.  We've even challenged ourselves to do better.  This year's theme takes doing better to another level.  You will hear speakers share their ideas on how doing is not enough, we as humans need to BE Better.  To be better means to do things at a higher degree often and consistently to create sustainability. Join us as we look at ways to Be Better humans. Are you ready to be a part of a network and connect with individuals who are Bold, Brilliant and Badass?Why TEDxUStreetWomenWomen are realizing that the way things used to be is not the way things should be. More and more, women are becoming empowered to break the glass ceilings and strive towards finding their place in leadership roles. Roles that challenges the old way of thinking while creating opportunities for women to make a difference in the world. Women are not new to leadership; think of Cleopatra or Queen Elizabeth. Think of the women who led the civil rights and education reform movements. However, women are still outnumbered by men in the most prestigious positions, from Capitol Hill to the board room.Although a lot is being done to change the way women are seen, much still needs to be done. Women make up more than half the U.S. population, yet there are only one in five women in Congress. Men still out pace women in salaries and positions. Women across the globe are regaining their confidence and becoming bold, brilliant and unapologetic. During this conference, we will celebrate, not only the successes of women, but ponder on ways to be innovative and inspirational. Ways to affect the planet and the people on it.We want to change the social norms and empower women to be Bold and Brilliant.  We don't want women to be ashamed of speaking their truths.  This platform is for Badass women who want to share their idea that can change the world!Why U Street Corridor?As a 6th generation Washingtonian, I’ve always known U Street to be a community build on activism. Arthur Ashe once said, “The corner of 14th and U was the grapevine. . . . If you were at that corner, you always had the sense that something big was about to happen”.  Known as Washington’s cultural center at the turn of the century, U Street has long been a backbone of the city’s homegrown jazz, arts, and civil rights movements. Once bearing the scars of riots and protests, today it has regained its rightful place as the street to showcase DC’s vibrant cultural life, from music and food to activism and art. U Street has historically brought Washingtonians together to the sound of its homegrown music, from jazz and blues to rock and go-go. Today its renovated clubs, new restaurants and shops are once again the center of DC’s humming nightlife. U Street is home for those who want to march to their own beat.  It’s both historic and colorful, boasting some of the richest culture of the city and full of bars, restaurants, and boutiques – as well as plenty of DC locals who come to enjoy the culture and the people-watching.

You think: maybe I just need better branding, paid ads, or a low-cost membership/course so more folks will buy – that’s what everyone else is doing, right?Here’s what I say: Whether you realize it or not, you easily attract folks in whatever you put your energy into. So let’s leverage that natural ability of yours into a business model that actually pays you well, and helps the people you already have right in front of you - even more - without needing thousands of followers or subscribers. I see so many talented coaches, experts, activists and entrepreneurs running businesses created to give their community a space to grow and connect together, but it’s driving the founder into the ground energetically and financially. That is not sustainable, folks!Here’s why you should listen to me:Hi! I’m Kylie (she/her), and I’m a double-certified business and life coach who helps ambitious community-builders convert enthusiastic fans to paying clients by building profitable businesses. Deepening connection is my secret sauce, and it’s the key to growing a healthy and profitable business (not to mention a healthy and satisfying life, too). The Profitable Community is a free masterclass for ambitious, people-focused entrepreneurs who want to grow their business without going broke in the process.Join me on zoom and I’ll share:What’s in a profitable, sustainable business modelHow to grow despite struggling with ADHD, anxiety or depressionThe key to making more money by *leveraging* what you already haveT﻿his masterclass is 1-part live training + 1-part networking.

And it all answers the question: “how can this better serve the community?”Your community is right in front of you, and they need you to have a business model that meets them where they are just as badly as you need one that doesn’t exhaust, overwhelm, or bankrupt you.That’s what I’m going to teach you in this totally free workshop.Save Your Seat Now!",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/kylie-hodges-20124375388,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-profitable-community-3-steps-to-grow-your-people-centered-business-tickets-646688772527,False,LA,False,0.9934066534042358

The talk will cover New Art City's areas of focus and the outcomes they produce including sustainability, accessibility, preservation and community building in the context of running an independent mission-driven company. As a toolkit for exhibiting art online, New Art City has navigated fine arts, culture, education and technology in a time of rapid change for the digital art world. The curation and product design prioritised those who are disadvantaged by structural injustice. New Art City is an artist-run virtual space founded in 2020 and led by Don Hanson and Sammie Veeler. Their browser-based tool for building 3D multiplayer websites supports a vibrant global community of artists, educators, and institutions. As an artist-run company, New Art City is redistributive by design, transferring knowledge, space, money and visibility from those who have it to those who don't. This year, they formed a non-profit research unit called Virtual Access Lab in partnership with Gray Area San Francisco to further advance their goals of web accessibility and preservation of digital culture.Talk will be followed by informal chat and drinks.This is an in person event hosted by Blessed Foundation.

You've exceeded goals and met deadlines set by other people, all while sensing that something's missing. This sense is your desire knocking on the door. The desire to redefine what success means, to celebrate and capture your journey as it unfolds, and to do it alongside supportive, like-minded individuals.

There is a reduction in tuition fee and savings for accommodation. You will be required to help out over the 5 day event including the open house on August 17th.info@academysacredgeometry.comSacred Geometry is a study of the universal language of truth, harmony, beauty, proportion, rhythm and order.  It is a blueprint of creation, an interface between the seen and unseen, the manifest and un-manifest. It is often described as the Architect of the Universe. Sacred Geometry is a term used to describe the patterns, shapes, and proportions found in nature and the cosmos, which are believed to have spiritual and metaphysical significance. It is the study of the inherent order and symmetry present in the universe. These geometric patterns are fundamental to understanding the nature of reality, and that they can help us unlock the secrets of the universe.Certain geometric shapes and ratios have specific energetic properties. For example, the golden ratio (also known as phi) is a mathematical ratio that appears frequently in nature, from the spirals of seashells to the proportions of the human body. We will deep-dive into a visual and educational extravaganza of how the Geometric Principles of Nature, Cosmos and the Ageless Wisdom lie behind an imminent Grand Unification of the Sciences, Arts & Global Consciousness.Throughout the history of the world, a hidden undercurrent of Ageless Wisdom (arising through the Mystery Schools, initiation and other transformative experiences) has existed alongside the traditional body of academic education.The student will depart from this course with a solid understanding of the Geometric Principles underlying the current Renaissance in the Sciences, Arts & Consciousness, together with a meaningful selection of Geometric Drawings & 3-D Constructions that will help illustrate this revelatory experience. What we will cover in this in this LIVE Face-to-Face Workshop (but is not limited to) :1.	  Cracking the Code of Plato’s Secret Doctrine – and Uncovering the Underlying Principles.2.	  The resulting golden mean number system and its central role in the Sciences, Arts & Consciousness.3.	  The Sacred Geometric Principles of Nature – focusing on bio-mimicry, ecology & sustainability.4.	  The Human Body – Aesthetic Canons of Proportion and Energetic Transformation.5.	  Sacred Measure, Golden Mandalas & Transformative Experience amongst the Ancient Egyptians, Chinese, Hebrew Kabbalists, Greeks, Aztecs, and Florentine Renaissance artists & philosophers.6.	  An enhanced group of drawings and 3-D geometric constructions, including Metatron’s Cube with the Flower of Life, Golden Chalice of Orion, Felt’s Mystic Kabbalistic Figure, the Golden Mandala, the 5 Platonic solids (including illustrative Archimedean & Catalan solids) and assemblage of a Golden Ruler.7.	  Resonance, Attunement and the Transformation of Consciousness. What it means to live in a Fractal Holographic Universe with Self-Similarity at each level, and the potential of the Whole Universe enfolded into each Part. In essence, we will “see” How the One becomes Many, and get a pretty good idea of How Each of the Many may return back unto the One.Scott Olsen, Ph.D. will focus on Sacred Geometric Principles related to:1.	The unveiling of Plato’s Secret Doctrine – fully revealing Plato’s Mystery of the One and Indefinite Dyad. Note: Pythagoras and Plato were both initiated into the Egyptian and Eleusinian Mysteries and were thus under the Sodalian oath of silence. Nevertheless, both maintained an oral doctrine or “agrapha dogmata,” their so-called Secret Doctrine.2.	The significance of numerous Biometric Anomalies – pointing again and again to the golden mean number system as the substructure of all reality, abductively leading to a Grand Unification of the Sciences, Arts and Consciousness.  3.	How this ubiquitous presence of the golden mean number system has emerged at the heart of quantum mechanics (including quark masses, chaos border, fine structure constant and entanglement), nanotechnology, crystallography, cryptography, genetics, DNA structure, biometric measurements of skulls, cardiac anatomy and physiology, phyllotaxis, weather turbulence, planetary orbits and sizes, black holes, dark energy, dark matter, and even cosmogenesis – the very origin and structure of the universe. 4.	And the realization that the golden mean number system lies at the heart of aesthetics, where form, function and performance coalesce in Beauty, Truth and the Good.The related drawings and philosophical insights:1.	The Golden Rectangle leading to the Golden Chalice of Orion – a single composite drawing showing how root two, root three, and the semi-elevation of the Great Pyramid arise naturally out of the Golden Section – the Primordial Scission.2.	George Henry Felt’s rediscovery of the Star of Perfection along with the Egyptian, Kabbalistic & Greek Canons of Proportion. Note: Felt’s lecture on this topic in H.P. Blavatsky’s apartment (here in New York city) was the catalyst for the founding of the Theosophical Society.3.	Discussion of how the hexagram (6), pentagram (5) and septagram (7) are involved in initiation and the transformation of consciousness.4.	A discussion (along with Harding) of the Mystery surrounding the 3 Means (Geometric, Harmonic and Arithmetic) and their special relation to the Series of Golden Powers.5.	A recognition of what we are actually doing: solving the greatest philosophical puzzle: “How does the One become the Many?” And further: “How do each of those Many return back to the One?” Recall Heraclitus: “The Way Up & the Way Down are One & the Same.”Melodi will focus on Sacred Geometry related to: 1.	The unveiling of Nature’s Genius by deep looking into her design processes using an art & science approach. This is to understand how she builds up synergistically from micro to macro, part to whole and vice-versa.2.	Meeting with Nature, our great mentor’s teachings of Life’s Principles from the fields of biomimicry, ecology and sustainability. 3.	Geometry of Space & Time within the perspective of the form and function core-relation.4.	Qi-Gong knowledge connected with our body and its movements in Traditional Chinese Wisdom. 5.	Visualization and experiencing our own unique self-expression.The related concepts, philosophical insights and drawings & constructions:1.	Free hand drawings analyzing nature’s shapes and forms.2.	Metatron’s Cube drawings and their relations with Sacred Geometry.3.	Part to whole relation as in natural building up processes with individual intuitions and teamwork experience. 4.	3D constructions of Platonic and some Archimedean and Catalan solids.5.	Golden Ruler construction along with experiencing nature’s Golden Section.Lance will focus on Sacred Geometry concepts and drawings related to:1.	The Golden Mandala geometric analysis of the Dendera Zodiac and The Aztec Calendar.2.	Solomon’s Temple, the Tabernacle of Moses & the Arc of the Covenant.3.	DaVinci’s Vitruvian Man and The Lost Golden Canon of Polyclitus.4.	Egyptian Canons of Proportion and the Ashmolean metrological figure.

MHYSA: Release Control,"September 29, 2023, 08:00 PM","September 29, 2023, 10:00 PM","159 Pioneer Street, Brooklyn, NY 11231","MHYSA, artist E. Jane’s underground pop star alter ego, will premiere a new live set performing songs from their forthcoming EP, Release Control (2023). Marking their growth as a vocalist, producer, and collaborator, the title acknowledges the necessary negotiations between control and release in making music. The first project released by MHYSA since the artist’s move from Philadelphia to Brooklyn three years ago, the record serves as a deep study into rap, R&B, and ambient electronic music, experimenting with how these styles can merge and separate.At Pioneer Works, MHYSA will perform with a full band, in a set that features a live video feed projected through both a lenticular and prism lens. These refractive apparatuses transform the performers’ bodily contours into ghostly silhouettes, casting a deliberately veiled and mediated image on stage. In doing so, the artist invites audience members to question the expectations of hyper-visibility so often imposed on Black divas and femmes. Known for installations that merge music, art, performance, and persona, E. Jane began developing MHYSA in 2015 as part of a new media practice focused on the interiority and labor of Black women and femmes. Conceived as a Gesamtkunstwerk—or “total work of art”—comprising video, performance, installation, and sound, Jane’s alter ego expresses the ultimate power of music to make utopian demands. MHYSA aims to create a world in which the needs, desires, and frustrations of Black femmes insistently take center stage. MHYSA: Release Control is commissioned by Pioneer Works, and curated by Jane Ursula Harris as the second installment of her HERETICS series, which presents works by performance artists who straddle a music-fine art divide. About the ArtistE. Jane (b. Bethesda, MD) is an interdisciplinary artist and musician based in Brooklyn, New York. Inspired by Black liberation and womanist praxis, their work explores the interiority and labor of Black women and femmes and the future of Blackness and queerness, as well as the perspectives of Black women and femmes navigating networked culture and surveillance. Since 2015, Jane has been developing the performance persona MHYSA, under which she released the critically acclaimed debut, fantasii, in 2018, and NEVAEH in 2020. The artist received their MFA from the University of Pennsylvania in 2016, and a BA in Art History with minors in English and Philosophy from Marymount Manhattan College in New York in 2012. Jane has performed at The Kitchen, MoMA, MoMA PS1 and Artist’s Space, as one half of sound duo SCRAAATCH alongside collaborator chukwumaa. In addition to winning the Wynn Newhouse Award in 2016, they have participated in residencies at the Studio Museum in Harlem (2019-2020) and, as part of SCRAAATCH, the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (2022) and Bemis Center (2023). Jane is also the author of NOPE (a manifesto), published in Glitch Feminism in 2020. Their first museum solo exhibition, Drenched in Light, is currently on view at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.About the CuratorJane Ursula Harris is a Brooklyn-based writer who has contributed to Artforum, Art in America, Bookforum, BOMB, Cultured Magazine, The Paris Review, Flash Art, Frieze, The Believer, GARAGE, and the Village Voice, among other publications.

Whether you are new to climbing or a seasoned veteran, we would love for you to join us in a discussion of basic emergency preparedness for the outdoors. We will discuss what to bring, what to know, and ways to stay safe. Join us for this lively and informative discussion and thematic giveaways, and then stay for one of NYC's best outdoor boulders - Rat Rock. Volunteers from NY3C will happily help out new climbers at the event. What are Mini-Clinics?: The outdoors should be for everyone, but not everyone has the access to the knowledge and education around it. NY3C is hosting mini-clinics to help bridge the gap to make the outdoors more accessible.Location: This event will take place at Rat Rock. Rat Rock is designated as Umpire Rock on Central Park maps. If you come up 7th Ave from Times Square and enter the park you see a playground straight ahead. Rat Rock is on the left. Rat Rock is in the SW corner of the park near the 59th Street Columbus Circle station. The SW side of the rock is clearly seen as you approach it from the park entrance.If you have any trouble accessing or finding Rat Rock, please call or text 765-994-1138. Cost: Mini-Clinics are FREE to attend, but if you would like to make a financial contribution for this clinic it would be much appreciated. Venmo code and donation link will be provided at the event.Donation receipts provided upon request.Other: Small snacks and water will be provided at the event, but if you would like to bring your own food, we encourage you to do so!  Rain Date: If for any reason the weather does not agree with our plans, the alternative rain date will be announced via Instagram story and emailed to registrants (follow us @nycclimbingcollective).Accessibility info: Central Park only has bouldering, which is shorter walls without a rope. Please understand all falls are ""ground"" falls, meaning the climber will land on the ground below. Climbing is inherently dangerous; you climb at your own risk. Central Park has accessible restrooms, but they are ample distance away from the boulders. If you would like to notify us or request accommodations to help make the event more accessible to you, please email Alana@NYCClimbingCollective.com",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/new-york-city-climbing-collective-33955883915,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/first-aid-mini-clinic-and-central-park-bouldering-night-tickets-681276234557,True,NYC,False,0.994768500328064

The Crisp Friday September 22nd Evening Concert,"September 22, 2023, 06:30 PM","September 22, 2023, 11:00 PM","4418 Bedwell Harbour Road, Pender Island, BC V0N 2M1, Canada","7pm MADDIE GLOVER AND FRIENDSI first heard Maddie at Mosaic last year and was immediately impressed by her confidence. She has immersed herself in Pender life and many of you will have encountered Maddie at the Talisman bookstore behind the counter!Maddie is 18 years old, and is a musician. She’s been playing music since the age of six, but only recently fell in love with songwriting. Maddie grew up in British Columbia, and moved to Pender Island in August 2021 with her family. She is passionate about writing, being outside, reading, and art, but most of all, music. Maddie is going to music school in the fall, where she hopes to further her musical abilities, and after that, she hopes to make performing and songwriting her career. At The Crisp Maddie will be welcoming some of her friends up, maybe family too, to join her on stage.7:40 LESTER QUITZAU WITH DAMIAN GRAHAM https://lesterq.com I knew of Tri-Continental for a long time and was always impressed how other musicians would talk about Lester in hushed tones regarding his stellar musicianship. 2023 is third time lucky for me trying to have Lester available for The Crisp! Damian Graham I have known for a long time as the drummer with my friend Maureen Washington.Bonus he is going to play with Lester! Oh yes, Lester is married to the wonderful Mae Moore whose music epitomises, for me, Pender Peace.Meet Canadian roots music artist and snowboarding pioneer and organic apple farmer Lester Quitzau, a mellow guy who throws down a heavy groove. In a field where intangibles like feel and integrity count for so much, Quitzau has forged an exemplary career. Distilling the experience of the past 33 years of writing, recording and performing his music, Lester has come up with an approach that is his own. His unique style and fluidity on slide, acoustic and electric guitars, coupled with his well crafted songs and warm vocals, are the fruits of this musical journey. Many of his followers have watched his career with love and loyalty in what began as a solid traditional folk/ blues foundation, that has branched out into myriad of influences and a sound that is his own. What began with a solid blues apprenticeship in the funky working-class bars of Alberta's capital city has grown into an eclectic and constantly evolving musical journey for the guitarist, singer, songwriter, composer and producer. He learned to play as a child, and by fifteen he'd saved enough to buy his first guitar, a Les Paul copy. Exposed to rock & roll by his older brother, and later the Pure blues of John Lee Hooker, the major blues influence of Lester's young life came at a skanky, cinder-block hotel in Edmonton called the Ambassador, long a mecca for legends direct from Chicago as well as the tight, inventive groups like Downchild Blues Band, Dutch Mason and David Wilcox.In the early 80s Lester was performing with a rocking blues trio called The Slipping Lizards. The band was popular in Edmonton, but the accompanying hard-partying lifestyle soon wore thin. The band split and in 1987 Lester continued with a band called The Yard Dogs which included Farley Scott, Dwayne Hrynkiw, and bass player Farley Scott, who was especially influential.In 1988 The Yard Dogs released Live at the Commodore. This was followed in 1989 by Take Time which was released under Lester's own name.In 1992 Lester won a JUNO Award for his contribution to Saturday Night Blues, a compilation album issued on Holger Petersen's Stony Plain Records label. After a move to BC's West Kootenays in 1993, Lester returned to Edmonton in 1994 and released his first album, Keep on Walking: an elemental, stripped down, funky all-acoustic approach to the blues.This was followed by A Big Love in 1996, a release that surprised listeners who might have been expecting a second instalment of the first album's straight-ahead acoustic blues. Where the first CD celebrated the traditional, the new one was mostly electric. And although the music was still blues-based, the album embraced experimentation and the wealth of possibilities an artist with Lester's talents could offer. The arrangements were multi-layered and often lush- effectively supporting and showcasing his arrival at a stronger and more confident level of song writing. His audience grew with the release of A Big Love, as did his stature among critics, resulting in his first JUNO Award nomination. The Lester Quitzau Band (Andy Graffiti, Brett Miles, Chris Byrne, Rob Vause, and Jason Cairns) set out on tour in 1996 in support of A Big Love, and for the first time he experienced the enthusiasm and respect of discerning European audiences. That same year Lester collaborated with Kent Sangster, Sandro Dominelli, and Dale James in the group A Love Supreme. Over the next five years Lester was discovered by an ever-widening international audience, primarily through his year-in, year-out touring on the folk/roots and jazz and blues festival circuits. - 2000 Lester partnered with Bill Bourne and Madagascar Slim to form Tri-Continental. Their first album won a JUNO award and the band toured extensively playing most of the major festivals across Canada. - 2001 the Very Electric Trio (Lester, Lyle Molzan and Greg Johnson) released So Here We Are. Like A Big Love, the album was a success and received many accolades: ""An absolutely stellar record"" - Cathy Ennis (CKUA Radio Network). - 2002 brought Lester's meeting, collaboration, and marriage to celebrated singer/songwriter Mae Moore. Their stripped down, acoustic recording Oh My was released in 2003, and met with success, garnering a West Coast Music Awards nomination.- 2003 Lester collaborated with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, for two performances at the prestigious Winspear Centre.Between 2002 and 2004 Tri-Continental released three more albums, and toured Europe and Canada extensively until 2006.From 2006 to 2009, Lester and Mae began to live their dream of a committed and sustainability-based relationship with their Gulf Island homestead. There they found a different rhythm: slower, more reflective, but certainly no less musical at its heart. This is the impulse that finds such powerful musical expression in The Same Light, released in 2009. It represents the culmination of Lester's years spent re-connecting with the land, but it's also a reflection of some serious musical wood-shedding and soul-searching done over that same period. The CD flows naturally from blues to ballads, and to truly inventive jazz improvisations. 2018 brought the re-union of Tri-Continental (Bill Bourne, Madagascar Slim and Lester). The Trio toured again extensively in Canada, returning to Europe, and with the addition of the most excellent, Michael Treadway on drums, recorded the well received ""Dust Dance” , in 2019. More touring in support of that release followed. Unfortunately 8:40 THE FRETLESS [ Vancouver ]https://www.thefretless.comI was judging for a particular national award and one of the great bonuses of judging is that you usually get to discover new musicians who are so abundantly talented. Such it was with The Fretless. I am very excited to hear them live on Pender!THE FRETLESS is the Canadian ensemble playing an essential part in the emerging movement mainstreaming traditional music, and connecting traditional styles with diverse audiences around the world. Through its deconstruction and transformation of the usual rhythmic, harmonic and structured arrangements of fiddle styles around the world, The Fretless is pushing traditional music to a new place, and has now issued itself an atypical challenge in the mission to find and convert fans unfamiliar with “progressive” traditional music. Starting with their debut album in 2012, the band has steadily pushed further into the public eye, winning Instrumental Album of the Year at the Western Canadian Music Awards and Instrumental Group of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards. Its 2014 tune “Waving To Ryan” has topped a million Spotify plays, and in 2016, The Fretless took home a Juno TM award for Instrumental Album of The Year for their album Bird’s Nest. 2018 saw the release of the band’s newest record, “Live from the Art Farm”, in which the band recorded ten all-new intricate arrangements in front of three microphones and an audience, straight to tape. The Fretless are just as likely to perform at a concert hall (most recently, halls such as the Royal Glasgow Concert hall in Scotland, The Colon Philharmonie in Germany, or the National Arts Centre in Ottawa) as a folk festival (such as Vancouver Island Folk Fest, Winnipeg Folk Fest, Memoirs et Racines). They can be found playing a pub one day and a chamber music festival the next; collaborating with a world-class vocalist (The Wailin’ Jenny’s, William Prince, Lennie Gallant) the weekend before a bluegrass festival. The band is taking their innovative and vibrant version of a string quartet to countless corners of the musical world, bringing audiences on a journey that transcends genre, defies stereotypes, and can only be described as The Fretless.“That experience (a Fretless show) provided a genuine turning point in my musical thinking and ongoing musical education.” - David Morrison, FRUK“It isn’t often that you come across instrumental music so beautiful that each track feels like brush strokes in a piece of artwork.” - Ben Ray, CherwellThe Fretless is Trent Freeman (Fiddle/Viola), Karrnnel Sawitsky (Fiddle/Viola), Ben Plotnick( Fiddle/Viola), and Eric Wright (Cello).

Some include a lack of self-confidence (e.g., impostor syndrome), putting other people's needs first, perfectionism, and burnout.Some of these limitations are rooted in the context in which we live. For example, women are constantly expected to meet society's conflicting demands: be extraordinary, practice self-care, spend quality time with family, and be good caregivers. How can you feel good enough in an environment demanding more and more?In this 1-hour master class, we will explore perfectionism and identify the keys to overcoming it. Perfectionism is the tendency to consider anything less than perfect as unacceptable. If not managed, it may produce: procrastination, high-stress levels, conflict in relationships, controlling behaviors, fear of failure, and lower performance (paradoxically.)By the end of this program, you will better understand how perfectionism impacts your life and obtain tools to overcome it. You will leave feeling empowered to pursue your goals with greater self-awareness and self-compassion.Before the event, you will receive a Zoom invitation.

CGPM will be used as a benchmark standard for mapping competence and measuring capabilities for Port and Terminal management functions among identified key managers.CGPM award will be an accreditation to the managers undergoing the program with due recognition to their capabilities. CGPM is a new professional qualification on Ports and Terminals management. Advantages of CGPM CGPM is an international benchmark of excellence that will be awarded to selected Ports and Terminals managers which will make the CGPM qualified managers stand out among the others.

And, while this statement is sometimes the unfortunate reality, the actual truth is far from it. In addition to creating and facilitating some of the most prominent and iconic works, female creators continue to develop and contribute to the art world in unprecedented ways. Women-in-Arts highlights some of the local women who're ushering Singapore toward a new and modern era of artistic achievement, while also gifting audiences fresh perspectives on the world as we know it. This panel will feature a diverse group of talented women, from a teacher and student pair, to an artist whose viral fan art has now set her on track to being published, to a designer in the eco-sustainability space, and a tattoo artist who has gone from apprenticeship to her own successful parlour in the last few years.About the SpeakersHijanah Hernandez (Moderator)From reviewing music and movies to being a content strategist at BBC StoryWorks, Hijanah's key underlying passion remains building a sustainable environment for the proliferating of the arts--and the more local, the better. Having forayed into her own world of storytelling with Everyday Hero Kucinta in the Singapore-madeanthology SingaHeroes, Hijanah's creative experiences offer her insight into the process, while also piquing her curiosity about others' journeys.Samara GanFrom fan art to original worlds, Samara's distinctive style and approach to the characters she loves have won the hearts of all who lay their eyes on her work. Now embarking on publication for her own story, Samara's journey from fan to author is one of dedication and inspiration.Cat SohFrom apprentice to a one-woman-show, Cat Soh has walked a path not many can claim to have. Known for her unique watercolour approach, Cat's love for visual arts has afforded her a wildly varying portfolio of clients who now bear her work and signature on the ultimate canvas: themselves.Tasha Leah SantiagoAn award-winning artist at the age of 16, Tasha's career and meteoric rise from impassioned student to published author are all that more impressive given her 20 years of age. Recurrently winning awards for her short stories, Tasha's followers know her for her firecracker personality which possesses her drawings and animations, as well as her artistically-influenced desserts and pastries.Gabriella AdytanthioLiving life across South-East Asia has afforded Gabriella an in-depth view of the arts and culture of the region. Meeting her graphic design-inspired approach to the visual arts, Gabriella's work often captures the hearts and minds of her audience right from the conceptual stage. Don't believe us? Just check out her Stray Cats Gallery.Clio Ding
As if creating the beloved Cyborgs & Dinosaurs comic strip wasn’t enough of a contribution to the local comic scene, Clio has also left an indelible mark on her many students. Beyond just educating the next generation of artists, she has also taken on the task of mentoring them outside of their curriculum. Paired with her student Tasha, Clio’s perspective as an arts teacher is one to remind us of the importance of its future.

The film’s high-profile protagonists—congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, activist leader Varshini Prakash (Sunrise Movement), political strategist Alexandra Rojas (Justice Democrats), and climate policy writer Rhiana Gunn-Wright—are each grappling with new challenges of leadership and power in the face of cynicism and uncertainty. Over four volatile years of crisis and upheaval, from street protests to the halls of Congress, these bold leaders fight to shift the narrative around climate, revealing the crisis as an opportunity to build a better society. Including up-to-the-minute footage that culminates in 2022’s landmark climate bill, ""To the End"" lifts the veil on the battle for the future of our world, and gives audiences a front seat view of history in the making.",New York Progressive Action Network,https://actionnetwork.org/events/screening-of-to-the-end,True,NYC,True,0.9863203167915344
