He’s a Senior Developer Advocate at Okta, where he specializes in supporting mobile and Python developers. He’s also the editor of Tampa Bay’s tech blog, Global Nerdy, home of the Tampa Bay Tech Events list, and organizes Tampa’s AI and Apple coding meetups. When he’s not programming or talking to programmers, he plays in a band called the Tropical Sons, does daily 10K bike rides around his neighborhood, plays tabletop and video games, and is always looking for interesting new places to hang out.Joey’s talk, “Centaurs vs. Minotaurs,” is a metaphor used in AI circles for two different approaches to human-AI synergy. In the “centaur” relationship (human head/horse body), the human is in charge and the AI follows its orders. Conversely in the “minotaur” relationship (bull head/human body), the AI is making the decisions and the human follows its orders.James Gress – Generative AI Director at Accenture – “Talk Track: exploring the groundbreaking realm of Generative AI.”James is a Generative AI Director for Accenture, bringing over 30 years of software delivery experience, leading global teams to break new ground in Generative AI solutions.

We will explore if we have created a new form of consciousness, with implications negative and positive.  Throughout the night, we will have fun by using generative AI such as Google’s MusicLM to make music.  And learn about the mechanics and implications of the viral AI Drake song.  Neither the conversation nor the music making session require prior knowledge of AI.About the hostDr. eMalick G.

Each class will involve some AI-inspired prompts, exercises and challenges as we explore new avenues for poetic expression. We'll consider the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence for artistic expression, discussing how its use in the creative process complicates our understanding of authorship, authenticity and originality. Finally, as some of you may have already begun to suspect, Chat GPT generated the majority of the text you are reading right now as part of the description for this class, which might also have been called CODE X: SIMULATED FREE VERSE.

One person, or even a small team, is minuscule relative to the number of people who need help. For example, since ChatGPT has exploded onto the scene, our children's future employment prospects (and current educational experience, with ChatGPT-powered cheating) are in existential danger. There is an area close to mathematics, however, which devises solutions in which problems solve themselves even through self-serving human behavior: Game Theory.The speaker is a pure math professor, researcher, and educator who transitioned to using Game Theory to develop new solutions for large-scale real-world problems. He will talk about his experience going from the ivory tower of academia into the practical mess of the real world.He will also discuss educational strategies that build relevant skills to survive this new era of Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT). He has been working extensively on this problem and draws from experience teaching across the entire spectrum, from underprivileged schools to the International Math Olympiad.This event will be completely different from an ordinary math talk. It will be fun and thought-provoking.Speaker InfoPo-Shen Loh is a social entrepreneur and inventor working across mathematics, education, and healthcare. He is a math professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the national coach of the USA International Mathematical Olympiad team. He has pioneered innovations ranging from a scalable way for people to learn challenging math live online from brilliant people to a new way to control pandemics by leveraging self-interest.He has earned distinctions ranging from an International Mathematical Olympiad silver medal to the USA Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. He was the coach of Carnegie Mellon University’s math team when it achieved its first-ever #1 rank among all North American universities, and the coach of the USA Math Olympiad team when it achieved its first-ever back-to-back #1-rank victories in 2015 and 2016, and then again in 2018 and 2019.

Yet, when “studying up,” with two of humankind’s most powerful instruments in its sights, STS runs the risk of capture, of fetishizing and celebrating the very analytic objects it seeks to critique. In this talk, Professor Jasanoff will trace an arc from the attacks on scientific self-regulation of the 1970s to today’s seemingly greater acceptance of locating ethical responsibility within—not outside—the centers of innovation. She will reflect on ways in which the co-productionist framework enables a wider understanding of the scope and purposes of STS critique.Sheila Jasanoff is Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies at the Harvard Kennedy School. A pioneer in the social sciences, she explores the role of science and technology in the law, politics, and policy of modern democracies. Her books include The Fifth Branch, Science at the Bar, Designs on Nature, The Ethics of Invention, and Can Science Make Sense of Life? . She founded and directs the STS Program at Harvard, where she also formed the Science and Democracy Network; previously, she was founding chair of the STS Department at Cornell. In 2022, she received the Government of Norway’s Holberg Prize for law, humanities, and social sciences. Her other honors include the SSRC’s Hirschman prize, the Humboldt Foundation’s Reimar-Lüst award, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Jasanoff has held distinguished visiting professorships at leading universities in Europe, Asia, Australia, and the US. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, foreign member of the British Academy and the Royal Danish Academy, and member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

We use art, theatre, games, stories, music, discussion, reflection, and action to empower students to make a difference in their world.Our program does not impose a fixed set of values or beliefs. Rather our goal is to provide a forum where students can identify their own values, expand their knowledge and gain skills essential to developing and following their own moral compass and voice. This fall we will be expanding our programming; adding a third instructor so that we can support a greater age range of students. Our in-person classes will be held on Sundays at 11:00 at 50 Prospect Park West (Location may change, but will remain in the general area).In each class we feature one of the 5 major principles of our program: Care for the self, family, community, earth, and world. As the program year progresses, we customize the curriculum guided by student interest. Previous lessons have included topics such as rising sea levels, ableism, implicit bias, animal welfare, educational access & emotional self-care.Each month students of all ages come together to put ethics into action with a service project. Past projects have included stocking a local community fridge, making enrichment toys for shelter animals and hosting a family fun day for refugee families. Similar to our classes, service activities are influenced by student passion and interests.Not sure if this program will be a good fit for your learner? We encourage you to contact us with questions.

In this talk, I will introduce the effort of developing faster and better representation of aerosol and aerosol-cloud interactions for a next-generation Earth system model by improving physics, increasing resolution, and utilizing machine learning techniques. In this effort, we have generated hundreds of terabytes of data that consists of process model, large-eddy, convection-permitting, and climate-scale perturbed physics simulations to train ML models. These ML models are used as new parameterizations in an Earth system model representing aerosol radiative properties, droplet nucleation, warm rain processes, and cloud adjustments, and as new diagnostic tools to reveal causal links between aerosol and the intricate Earth system. I will discuss our progress as well as challenges we encountered when integrating the ML models in the Earth system model.Bio: Po-Lun Ma is an Earth scientist in Atmospheric Sciences & Global Change Division at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). He studies aerosol and clouds as well as their roles in the climate system. He co-leads the Directorate Objective of Transforming Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling with AI/ML in Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate at PNNL. He is the Principal Investigator of DOE’s “Enabling Aerosol-cloud interactions at GLobal convection-permitting scalES (EAGLES)” project to improve the representation of aerosol and aerosol-cloud interactions in DOE’s Earth system model with new modeling techniques that are scientifically robust and computationally efficient.Learn More: LEAP PO-LUN MA (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/leap-center-45565168003,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/improving-aerosol-in-an-earth-system-model-with-aiml-tickets-685848460207,NYC
Honoring the Badge: Spotting and Avoiding Ethical Pitfalls,"September 11, 2023, 08:30 AM","September 11, 2023, 12:30 PM","214 Oldham Rd, Wayne, NJ 07470","Modern policing takes place in an ethical minefield – from the street to the courthouse, from management to recruiting, from training to on and off-duty conduct. The mission of the Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative at Drake University is to help agencies shape, enhance, and fortify their ethical culture and prevent misconduct from eroding confidence in the public sector. The highly acclaimed Honoring the Badge police ethics Agency and Command Staff programs take a deep dive into applied ethics and deal with the hidden and ignored ethical challenges within law enforcement. The course was created by world-renowned ethicist Michael Josephson and Detective Captain James Dugan. Jim, whose highly decorated NJ police career was derailed by one bad judgment, provides a unique, sobering, and inspiring perspective.This presentation addresses the following critical organizational needs:• The major causes of unethical behavior within a law enforcement agency. • The inherent career and officer wellness consequences of unethical behavior - long and short term. • The liability of ethical compromise from the legal and public support point of view. • The critical nature of ethical behavior as a “risk management” strategy. • The Six Pillars of Character® - applying them within your agency.About Jim Dugan, Lead Instructor: During his 13-year law enforcement career, Jim worked primarily in narcotic enforcement and police training. He received numerous awards and accommodations for his work and spoke at several state-wide law enforcement conferences throughout the northeast. He achieved the rank of Captain of Detectives at 32 when he was appointed Director of a New Jersey State Certified Police Training Academy. Unfortunately, Jim’s highly decorated police career ended abruptly in 1997 because of an unethical compromise.After a remarkably successful 25-year career in the private sector, Jim has now committed his time to educate and support the policing community by providing expert insights and resources that promote professional  development in the critical area of police ethics. Since its creation in 2019, the “Honoring the Badge” police ethics program has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from the law enforcement community and is now available for the training of entire police agencies and command staffs. This training is a POST Certified police ethics course in California and is presented in both recruit and in-service training programs.Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative at Drake UniversityThe Robert D. and Billie Ray Center at Drake University is home to the Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative, which provides character and leadership development strategies to improve civility and develop ethical leaders throughout the law enforcement community.To accomplish this, the Institute advocates five core principles: 	1. Place public interest over all other considerations including personal or private interests.	2. Make decisions on the merits, free from partiality, prejudice, or conflicts of interest.	3. Conduct police operations openly, efficiently, equitably, and honorably.	4. Observe the letter and spirit of the law.	5. Avoid appearances of impropriety or unethical conduct.Programs and ServicesWe offer a variety of approaches for ethics training that address specific agency needs and that are meaningful, measurable, and sustainable.

Honoring the Badge: Spotting and Avoiding Ethical Pitfalls,"September 13, 2023, 08:30 AM","September 13, 2023, 12:30 PM","281 Campgaw Rd, Mahwah, NJ 07430","Every day, law enforcement personnel are presented with choices that can have long-term career consequences. Ethical behavior and decision-making are vital to the success and reputation of every law enforcement agency and the well-being of every officer. This presentation takes a deep dive into applied ethics and deals with hidden and ignored ethical challenges within law enforcement. The course was created by world-renowned ethicist Michael Josephson and Detective Captain James Dugan. Jim, whose highly decorated NJ police career was derailed by one bad judgment, provides a unique, sobering, and inspiring perspective. 
This presentation addresses the following critical organizational needs: 
• The major causes of unethical behavior within a law enforcement agency. 
• The inherent career and officer wellness consequences of unethical behavior - long and short term. 
• The liability of ethical compromise from the legal and public support point of view. 
• The critical nature of ethical behavior as a “risk management” strategy. 
• The Six Pillars of Character® - applying them within your agency.
About Jim Dugan, Lead Instructor: 
During his 13-year law enforcement career, Jim worked primarily in narcotic enforcement and police training. He received numerous awards and accommodations for his work and spoke at several state-wide law enforcement conferences throughout the northeast. He achieved the rank of Captain of Detectives at 32 when he was appointed Director of a New Jersey State Certified Police Training Academy. Unfortunately, Jim’s highly decorated police career ended abruptly in 1997 because of an unethical compromise. In this course, Jim takes you through the painful journey, both professionally and personally, that resulted from his conduct. 
Since then, Jim has had a very successful career in the private sector and now commits his time to educating and supporting the policing community. He provides expert insights and critical resources in police ethics professional development. 
Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative at Drake University: 
Modern policing takes place in an ethical minefield – from the street to the courthouse, from management to recruiting, from training to on and off-duty conduct. The Robert D. and Billie Ray Center at Drake University is home to the Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative, whose mission is to help agencies shape, enhance, and fortify their ethical culture and to prevent misconduct from eroding confidence in the public sector. 
To accomplish this, the Institute advocates five core principles: 
1. Place public interest over all other considerations including personal or private interests. 
2. Make decisions on the merits, free from partiality, prejudice, or conflicts of interest. 
3. Conduct police operations openly, efficiently, equitably, and honorably. 
4. Observe the letter and spirit of the law. 
5. Avoid appearances of impropriety or unethical conduct.

We offer a variety of approaches for ethics training that address specific agency needs and that are meaningful, measurable, and sustainable.
