He’s a Senior Developer Advocate at Okta, where he specializes in supporting mobile and Python developers. He’s also the editor of Tampa Bay’s tech blog, Global Nerdy, home of the Tampa Bay Tech Events list, and organizes Tampa’s AI and Apple coding meetups. When he’s not programming or talking to programmers, he plays in a band called the Tropical Sons, does daily 10K bike rides around his neighborhood, plays tabletop and video games, and is always looking for interesting new places to hang out.Joey’s talk, “Centaurs vs. Minotaurs,” is a metaphor used in AI circles for two different approaches to human-AI synergy. In the “centaur” relationship (human head/horse body), the human is in charge and the AI follows its orders. Conversely in the “minotaur” relationship (bull head/human body), the AI is making the decisions and the human follows its orders.James Gress – Generative AI Director at Accenture – “Talk Track: exploring the groundbreaking realm of Generative AI.”James is a Generative AI Director for Accenture, bringing over 30 years of software delivery experience, leading global teams to break new ground in Generative AI solutions.

Indian Secret Singles Social Event: A New Way To Meet Indian Singles In NYC,"August 16, 2023, 07:00 PM","August 16, 2023, 08:55 PM","New York - Midtown Manhattan ANNOUNCED AFTER SIGN UP, New York, NY 10022","Come and check out this revolutionary new event for Indian singles in NYC.WHAT IS SECRET SINGLES SOCIAL?Secret Singles Social is an event that is changing the way people meet people in NYC. Have you ever been at a bar or lounge, looked around and wondered, ""Who is single in here?"". This event was born when the founder of the company found himself sitting at a bar and wondering exactly that. He then thought, ""Wouldn't it be cool to know who was single?"". The light bulb went off and he created the Secret Singles Social Event...This event is the perfect, laid back way to meet other Indian singles at your own pace without the endless swiping on dating apps and the pressure of going on one on one dates.***************************************************WE DO DIFFERENT AGE RANGES FOR EACH SECRET SINGLES SOCIAL EVENT SO CHECK THE CALENDAR BELOW FOR EVENT DATES AND AGE RANGES:* QUICK NOTE - WE REALIZE THERE ARE SEVERAL TICKET LISTINGS FOR AUGUST 16th - THEY ARE ALL THE SAME EVENT SO JUST CHOOSE ANY ONE OF THE TICKET LINKS... SORRY FOR ANY CONFUSION)EVENT CALENDAR:WEDNESDAY AUGUST 16th - Ages 20s, 30s & 40sWEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 13th - Ages 20s & 30sWEDNESDAY OCTOBER 11th - AGES 30s, 40s & 50s***************************************************IMPORTANT NOTE:THERE WILL BE SINGLES FROM OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS ATTENDING THIS EVENT AS WELL BE WE INVITED A LOT OF INDIAN SINGLES SO WE EXPECT A GOOD AMOUNT OF INDIAN SINGLES TO BE IN ATTENDANCE. ALL INDIAN SINGLES WITH HAVE A UNIQUE SYMBOL (EXPLAINED BELOW) SO YOU'LL EASILY BE ABLE TO FIN D THE OTHER INDIAN SINGLES AT THE EVENT... HOWEVER YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT LIMITED TO MINGLING WITH ONLY THE INDIAN SINGLES AT THE EVENT... FEEL FREE TO MINGLE AND CONVERSE WITH ANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE AS WELL. KEEP IN MIND THAT THOSE WITH A DIFFERENT SYMBOL THAN YOU MIGHT NOT BE SINGLE BECAUSE THIS EVENT IS PART OF A BIGGER NETWORKING EVENT. NOT ALL OF THE CROWD WILL BE INDIAN AND NOT ALL  OF THE CROWD WILL BE SINGLE. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO EASILY IDENTIFY THE INDIAN SINGLES BY THEIR SECRET SYMBOL. THE MAGIC OF THE EVENT IS THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THE OTHERS THAT MATCH WHAT/WHO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THE SAME SECRET SYMBOL AS YOU. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY MIGHT HAVE A STAR AS THEIR SECRET SYMBOL, THOSE WHO ARE INDIAN SINGLES MIGHT HAVE A DIAMOND WITH A DOT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AS THEIR SECRET SYMBOL, ETC... IN  OTHER WORDS, YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO MINGLE AND CONNECT WITH EVERYONE AT THE EVENT BUT YOU'LL EASILY BE ABLE TO LOCATE THE OTHER INDIAN SINGLES BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THE SAME SECRET SYMBOL AS YOURS!SECRET LOCATION & SECRET SYMBOL:Each Secret Singles Social Event is held at a different secret location in Manhattan. We always choose quality bars that are generally somewhere near midtown. We choose venues that are easy to get to for most people in NYC (We don't pick places above 79th St. or Below 25th St. so they are easy for most people to get to by Subway or Uber). This is not a structured or overly organized event. Think of it as a fun alternative to going to grab some drinks at a bar alone. Feel free to come with a friend/s as well. We'd say about 75% of the crowd comes on their own. We kept the event price much more affordable than a standard singles event so everyone can afford it.After signing up you will get an email from us with the location of the event. In that email we'll also give you a secret symbol that will let the other attendees know you're part of the event. We will email you a printable paper bracelet template with your secret symbol on it (SEE IMAGE BELOW TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MEAN). If you don't have access to a printer you can simply draw that secret symbol on the back of your hand with a marker or pen before arriving at the event.Then you simply show up at the venue at the listed start time and get started meeting people. There are no name tags, no host and no awkward check-in process. This means that only you and the other attendees will even know that you're at a singles event! (The venue is not directly involved with the event so please don't ask their staff questions as they likely won't have answers)...You'll simply look for other people with the secret symbol on their hand to know they're also single and part of the event.ICEBREAKERS TO WIN A $50 AMAZON GIFT CARD!Before the event we'll also email you icebreaker questions that you can use to get to know the rest of the singles at the event. The icebreakers are optional but most people love them because they really help you get to know people and gauge compatibility. In the email we send you before the event we'll explain exactly how the icebreaker works but essentially you'll be asking and/or being asked 3 icebreaker questions. If you complete the icebreaker you'll be entered into a raffle and one of the event attendees will win a $50 Amazon gift card!EXAMPLES OF SOME OF OUR FUN ICEBREAKER QUESTIONS:* If you had a time machine - where would you take it to?

Asian Secret Singles Social Event: A New Way To Meet Asian Singles In NYC,"August 16, 2023, 07:00 PM","August 16, 2023, 09:10 PM","New York - Midtown Manhattan ANNOUNCED AFTER SIGN UP, New York, NY 10022","Come and check out this revolutionary new event for Asian singles in NYC.WHAT IS SECRET SINGLES SOCIAL?Secret Singles Social is an event that is changing the way people meet people in NYC. Have you ever been at a bar or lounge, looked around and wondered, ""Who is single in here?"". This event was born when the founder of the company found himself sitting at a bar and wondering exactly that. He then thought, ""Wouldn't it be cool to know who was single?"". The light bulb went off and he created the Secret Singles Social Event...This event is the perfect, laid back way to meet other Asian singles at your own pace without the endless swiping on dating apps and the pressure of going on one on one dates.***************************************************WE DO DIFFERENT AGE RANGES FOR EACH SECRET SINGLES SOCIAL EVENT SO CHECK THE CALENDAR BELOW FOR EVENT DATES AND AGE RANGES:* QUICK NOTE - WE REALIZE THERE ARE SEVERAL TICKET LISTINGS FOR AUGUST 16th - THEY ARE ALL THE SAME EVENT SO JUST CHOOSE ANY ONE OF THE TICKET LINKS... SORRY FOR ANY CONFUSION)EVENT CALENDAR:WEDNESDAY AUGUST 16th - Ages 20s, 30s & 40sWEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 13th - Ages 20s & 30sWEDNESDAY OCTOBER 11th - AGES 30s, 40s & 50s***************************************************QUICK IMPORTANT NOTE:THERE WILL BE SINGLES FROM OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS ATTENDING THIS EVENT AS WELL BE WE INVITED A LOT OF INDIAN SINGLES SO WE EXPECT A GOOD AMOUNT OF ASIAN SINGLES TO BE IN ATTENDANCE. ALL ASIAN SINGLES WITH HAVE A UNIQUE SYMBOL (EXPLAINED BELOW) SO YOU'LL EASILY BE ABLE TO FIN D THE OTHER INDIAN SINGLES AT THE EVENT... HOWEVER YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT LIMITED TO MINGLING WITH ONLY THE INDIAN SINGLES AT THE EVENT... FEEL FREE TO MINGLE AND CONVERSE WITH ANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE AS WELL. KEEP IN MIND THAT THOSE WITH A DIFFERENT SYMBOL THAN YOU MIGHT NOT BE SINGLE BECAUSE THIS EVENT IS PART OF A BIGGER NETWORKING EVENT. NOT ALL OF THE CROWD WILL BE ASIAN AND NOT ALL  OF THE CROWD WILL BE SINGLE. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO EASILY IDENTIFY THE INDIAN SINGLES BY THEIR SECRET SYMBOL. THE MAGIC OF THE EVENT IS THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THE OTHERS THAT MATCH WHAT/WHO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THE SAME SECRET SYMBOL AS YOU. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY MIGHT HAVE A STAR AS THEIR SECRET SYMBOL, THOSE WHO ARE ASIAN SINGLES MIGHT HAVE A DIAMOND WITH A DOT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AS THEIR SECRET SYMBOL, ETC... IN  OTHER WORDS, YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO MINGLE AND CONNECT WITH EVERYONE AT THE EVENT BUT YOU'LL EASILY BE ABLE TO LOCATE THE OTHER ASIAN SINGLES BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THE SAME SECRET SYMBOL AS YOURS!SECRET LOCATION & SECRET SYMBOL:Each Secret Singles Social Event is held at a different secret location in Manhattan. We always choose quality bars that are generally somewhere near midtown. We choose venues that are easy to get to for most people in NYC (We don't pick places above 79th St. or Below 25th St. so they are easy for most people to get to by Subway or Uber). This is not a structured or overly organized event. Think of it as a fun alternative to going to grab some drinks at a bar alone. Feel free to come with a friend/s as well. We'd say about 75% of the crowd comes on their own. We kept the event price much more affordable than a standard singles event so everyone can afford it.After signing up you will get an email from us with the location of the event. In that email we'll also give you a secret symbol that will let the other attendees know you're part of the event. We will email you a printable paper bracelet template with your secret symbol on it (SEE IMAGE BELOW TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MEAN). If you don't have access to a printer you can simply draw that secret symbol on the back of your hand with a marker or pen before arriving at the event.Then you simply show up at the venue at the listed start time and get started meeting people. There are no name tags, no host and no awkward check-in process. This means that only you and the other attendees will even know that you're at a singles event! (The venue is not directly involved with the event so please don't ask their staff questions as they likely won't have answers)...You'll simply look for other people with the secret symbol on their hand to know they're also single and part of the event.ICEBREAKERS TO WIN A $50 AMAZON GIFT CARD!Before the event we'll also email you icebreaker questions that you can use to get to know the rest of the singles at the event. The icebreakers are optional but most people love them because they really help you get to know people and gauge compatibility. In the email we send you before the event we'll explain exactly how the icebreaker works but essentially you'll be asking and/or being asked 3 icebreaker questions. If you complete the icebreaker you'll be entered into a raffle and one of the event attendees will win a $50 Amazon gift card!EXAMPLES OF SOME OF OUR FUN ICEBREAKER QUESTIONS:* If you had a time machine - where would you take it to? Would you stay there?* Do you usually follow your heart or your head?* Would you rather live for one year on an island by yourself or for one year in a small apartment with 7 strangers?* What is one thing you’ve always wanted to cross off your bucket list, but haven’t yet?WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT SECRET SINGLES SOCIAL EVENTS:""I was getting tired of the endless swiping on dating apps so thought I'd try something new. It was refreshing meeting people in real life in such a laid back and relaxed way"". ""An ingeniously mysterious and fun way to meet singles"" - Social Vibes Podcast""It basically just looked and felt like I was just having a cocktail  at a bar but at the same time I also to interact with some cool people. My best friend met her current boyfriend at one of these events so I thought I'd give it a try. I was happy I did. It was a great experience."" .""I loved the icebreaker questions because it takes the pressure off having to come up with something to talk about"" WHAT THIS EVENT IS NOT:Keep in my that there are no hosts and this not an overly structured or organized event. It's just a fun, clever way to meet other singles in your age range. Essentially we're providing you with a meeting place and an activity to help  you make connections. It's the perfect way to meet people at your own pace. We've witnessed countless relationships and connections form at Secret Singles Events so come on out!FAQ:HOW MANY WILL BE ATTENDING?It ranges from event to event. We usually have between 15 and 50 people sign up.WHAT IS THE AGE RANGE?It varies from event to event so check the calendar. If you're within a few years of the suggested age range you're welcome to attend.CAN I COME ALONE?Yes, about 75% come on their own.WHAT IS THE DRESS CODE?While we don't have a dress code we ask that you please look neat/presentable. What you wear to work, for after work drinks or on a semi casual date is likely fine.CAN I PAY AT THE EVENT DOOR?We do not accept payment at the event door. We also change the venue at each event and don't give out the location to those who don't sign up.

Secret Singles Social Event For Black Singles In NYC,"August 16, 2023, 07:30 PM","August 16, 2023, 09:25 PM","New York - Midtown Manhattan ANNOUNCED AFTER SIGN UP, New York, NY 10022","Come and check out this revolutionary new event for black singles in NYC.WHAT IS SECRET SINGLES SOCIAL?Secret Singles Social is an event that is changing the way people meet people in NYC. Have you ever been at a bar or lounge, looked around and wondered, ""Who is single in here?"". This event was born when the founder of the company found himself sitting at a bar and wondering exactly that. He then thought, ""Wouldn't it be cool to know who was single?"". The light bulb went off and he created the Secret Singles Social Event...This event is the perfect, laid back way to meet other black singles at your own pace without the endless swiping on dating apps and the pressure of going on one on one dates.***************************************************WE DO DIFFERENT AGE RANGES FOR EACH SECRET SINGLES SOCIAL EVENT SO CHECK THE CALENDAR BELOW FOR EVENT DATES AND AGE RANGES:* QUICK NOTE - WE REALIZE THERE ARE SEVERAL TICKET LISTINGS FOR AUGUST 16th - THEY ARE ALL THE SAME EVENT SO JUST CHOOSE ANY ONE OF THE TICKET LINKS... SORRY FOR ANY CONFUSION)EVENT CALENDAR:WEDNESDAY AUGUST 16th - Ages 20s, 30s & 40sWEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 13th - Ages 20s & 30sWEDNESDAY OCTOBER 11th - AGES 30s, 40s & 50s***************************************************IMPORTANT NOTE:THERE WILL BE SINGLES FROM OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS ATTENDING THIS EVENT AS WELL BE WE INVITED A LOT OF BLACK SINGLES SO WE EXPECT A GOOD AMOUNT OF INDIAN SINGLES TO BE IN ATTENDANCE. ALL BLACK SINGLES WITH HAVE A UNIQUE SYMBOL (EXPLAINED BELOW) SO YOU'LL EASILY BE ABLE TO FIN D THE OTHER INDIAN SINGLES AT THE EVENT... HOWEVER YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT LIMITED TO MINGLING WITH ONLY THE INDIAN SINGLES AT THE EVENT... FEEL FREE TO MINGLE AND CONVERSE WITH ANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE AS WELL. KEEP IN MIND THAT THOSE WITH A DIFFERENT SYMBOL THAN YOU MIGHT NOT BE SINGLE BECAUSE THIS EVENT IS PART OF A BIGGER NETWORKING EVENT. NOT ALL OF THE CROWD WILL BE BLACK AND NOT ALL  OF THE CROWD WILL BE SINGLE. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO EASILY IDENTIFY THE OTHER BLACK SINGLES BY THEIR SECRET SYMBOL. THE MAGIC OF THE EVENT IS THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THE OTHERS THAT MATCH WHAT/WHO YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THE SAME SECRET SYMBOL AS YOU. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY MIGHT HAVE A STAR AS THEIR SECRET SYMBOL, THOSE WHO ARE BLACK SINGLES MIGHT HAVE A DIAMOND WITH A DOT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AS THEIR SECRET SYMBOL, ETC... IN  OTHER WORDS, YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO MINGLE AND CONNECT WITH EVERYONE AT THE EVENT BUT YOU'LL EASILY BE ABLE TO LOCATE THE OTHER BLACK SINGLES BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THE SAME SECRET SYMBOL AS YOURS!SECRET LOCATION & SECRET SYMBOL:Each Secret Singles Social Event is held at a different secret location in Manhattan. We always choose quality bars that are generally somewhere near midtown. We choose venues that are easy to get to for most people in NYC (We don't pick places above 79th St. or Below 25th St. so they are easy for most people to get to by Subway or Uber). This is not a structured or overly organized event. Think of it as a fun alternative to going to grab some drinks at a bar alone. Feel free to come with a friend/s as well. We'd say about 75% of the crowd comes on their own. We kept the event price much more affordable than a standard singles event so everyone can afford it.After signing up you will get an email from us with the location of the event. In that email we'll also give you a secret symbol that will let the other attendees know you're part of the event. We will email you a printable paper bracelet template with your secret symbol on it (SEE IMAGE BELOW TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE MEAN). If you don't have access to a printer you can simply draw that secret symbol on the back of your hand with a marker or pen before arriving at the event.Then you simply show up at the venue at the listed start time and get started meeting people. There are no name tags, no host and no awkward check-in process. This means that only you and the other attendees will even know that you're at a singles event! (The venue is not directly involved with the event so please don't ask their staff questions as they likely won't have answers)...You'll simply look for other people with the secret symbol on their hand to know they're also single and part of the event.ICEBREAKERS TO WIN A $50 AMAZON GIFT CARD!Before the event we'll also email you icebreaker questions that you can use to get to know the rest of the singles at the event. The icebreakers are optional but most people love them because they really help you get to know people and gauge compatibility. In the email we send you before the event we'll explain exactly how the icebreaker works but essentially you'll be asking and/or being asked 3 icebreaker questions. If you complete the icebreaker you'll be entered into a raffle and one of the event attendees will win a $50 Amazon gift card!EXAMPLES OF SOME OF OUR FUN ICEBREAKER QUESTIONS:* If you had a time machine - where would you take it to? Would you stay there?* Do you usually follow your heart or your head?* Would you rather live for one year on an island by yourself or for one year in a small apartment with 7 strangers?* What is one thing you’ve always wanted to cross off your bucket list, but haven’t yet?WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT SECRET SINGLES SOCIAL EVENTS:""I was getting tired of the endless swiping on dating apps so thought I'd try something new. It was refreshing meeting people in real life in such a laid back and relaxed way"". ""An ingeniously mysterious and fun way to meet singles"" - Social Vibes Podcast""It basically just looked and felt like I was just having a cocktail  at a bar but at the same time I also to interact with some cool people. My best friend met her current boyfriend at one of these events so I thought I'd give it a try. I was happy I did. It was a great experience."" .""I loved the icebreaker questions because it takes the pressure off having to come up with something to talk about"" WHAT THIS EVENT IS NOT:Keep in my that there are no hosts and this not an overly structured or organized event. It's just a fun, clever way to meet other singles in your age range. Essentially we're providing you with a meeting place and an activity to help  you make connections. It's the perfect way to meet people at your own pace. We've witnessed countless relationships and connections form at Secret Singles Events so come on out!FAQ:HOW MANY WILL BE ATTENDING?It ranges from event to event. We usually have between 15 and 50 people sign up.WHAT IS THE AGE RANGE?It varies from event to event so check the calendar. If you're within a few years of the suggested age range you're welcome to attend.CAN I COME ALONE?Yes, about 75% come on their own.WHAT IS THE DRESS CODE?While we don't have a dress code we ask that you please look neat/presentable. What you wear to work, for after work drinks or on a semi casual date is likely fine.CAN I PAY AT THE EVENT DOOR?We do not accept payment at the event door. We also change the venue at each event and don't give out the location to those who don't sign up. You must pre-pay online.HOW LONG DOES THE EVENT GO?The event is 2 hours long, however the venue won't kick you out after 2 hours. So if you're having some good conversation you're welcome to stay there as long as you'd like.IS THERE A REFUND POLICY?If you need to cancel, please email us and we can transfer you to a future event. However we do not offer transfers if you cancel on the day of the event or don't show up.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/social-events-20157541940,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/secret-singles-social-event-for-black-singles-in-nyc-tickets-664195365217,False,NYC,/Users/raiidahmed/PycharmProjects/Event-Extractor-With-GUI/CSV_URL_DATA/AI Governance/AI_Governance_eventbrite_Social AI_NYC.csv

It is the tale of Aksenty Ivanovich Poprishchin, a lowly government clerk who gradually descends into madness. At the beginning, Poprischin records his frustrations and humiliations with restraint, rationalizing various attacks from society to his dignity. Over time, however, reason gives way to delusion and his schizophrenic mumblings spin out of control. Through journal entries, Poprishchin leads us through the corridors of his topsy-turvy world, from his hateful job and crush on his employer's daughter, to his encounters with letter-writing dogs, to the torture he undergoes at the hands of the Spanish ""Inquisitor."" Tom Schubert comes spectacularly unhinged in the title role along with actors Albert Baker, Sarah O’Donnell and Luisa Menzen.

In this talk, I will introduce the effort of developing faster and better representation of aerosol and aerosol-cloud interactions for a next-generation Earth system model by improving physics, increasing resolution, and utilizing machine learning techniques. In this effort, we have generated hundreds of terabytes of data that consists of process model, large-eddy, convection-permitting, and climate-scale perturbed physics simulations to train ML models. These ML models are used as new parameterizations in an Earth system model representing aerosol radiative properties, droplet nucleation, warm rain processes, and cloud adjustments, and as new diagnostic tools to reveal causal links between aerosol and the intricate Earth system. I will discuss our progress as well as challenges we encountered when integrating the ML models in the Earth system model.Bio: Po-Lun Ma is an Earth scientist in Atmospheric Sciences & Global Change Division at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). He studies aerosol and clouds as well as their roles in the climate system. He co-leads the Directorate Objective of Transforming Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling with AI/ML in Earth and Biological Sciences Directorate at PNNL. He is the Principal Investigator of DOE’s “Enabling Aerosol-cloud interactions at GLobal convection-permitting scalES (EAGLES)” project to improve the representation of aerosol and aerosol-cloud interactions in DOE’s Earth system model with new modeling techniques that are scientifically robust and computationally efficient.Learn More: LEAP PO-LUN MA (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/leap-center-45565168003,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/improving-aerosol-in-an-earth-system-model-with-aiml-tickets-685848460207,False,NYC,/Users/raiidahmed/PycharmProjects/Event-Extractor-With-GUI/CSV_URL_DATA/AI Governance/AI_Governance_eventbrite_AI Governance_NYC.csv

Books of Wonder is electrified to host the launch for The Infinity Particle by WENDY XU! From the talented illustrator of Mooncakes (a Books of Wonder favorite!) comes the intriguing story in graphic novel form of a robotics engineer falling for a humanoid AI, and then questioning everything about her work. Where is the line between AI and human?In The Infinity Particle by WENDY XU, Clementine Chang moves from Earth to Mars to start over. On the first day of her dream job working for Dr. Marcella Lin, an Artificial Intelligence pioneer, Clem meets Dr. Lin’s assistant, a gorgeous, yet cold humanoid AI named Kye. Sure, Clem has built her own robot—a cute moth-shaped companion named SENA — but Kye feels almost… human.When Clem and Kye begin to work together, their chemistry sets off sparks. The only downside? Dr. Lin won’t allow Kye to become more independent. And their relationship is causing Clem to question everything she knows about her work. After all, if Kye is sentient enough to have feelings, shouldn’t he be able to have his own thoughts? Where is the line between AI and human? As her future and her past weigh down on her, Clem becomes determined to help Kye break free— even if it means risking everything she came to Mars for.

Rhymes Against Humanity: The Poetry of Chat GPT,"August 01, 2023, 12:00 PM","August 01, 2023, 01:00 PM","144 Montague Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201","This in-person, weekly drop-in class, which might also have been called RAGE AGAINST THE ROBOTS, will delve into the poetic consciousness of Chat GPT, exploring the unique ways in which this particular artificial intelligence language model generates, processes and produces “poetry.” We'll examine the intricacies and limitations of its syntax and discuss the creative possibilities that arise from using computers as inspiration. Each class will involve some AI-inspired prompts, exercises and challenges as we explore new avenues for poetic expression. We'll consider the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence for artistic expression, discussing how its use in the creative process complicates our understanding of authorship, authenticity and originality. Finally, as some of you may have already begun to suspect, Chat GPT generated the majority of the text you are reading right now as part of the description for this class, which might also have been called CODE X: SIMULATED FREE VERSE.

Between Extinction & the Singularity: A Co-Productionist Take on AI Ethics,"August 03, 2023, 04:00 PM","August 03, 2023, 06:00 PM","RD Watt Building, The University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Speaker: Professor Sheila Jasanoff, Harvard UniversitySTS has set itself up to be the critical field that puts the social production of science and technology under its lens, much as sociology studies society, anthropology studies culture, or political science studies politics. Yet, when “studying up,” with two of humankind’s most powerful instruments in its sights, STS runs the risk of capture, of fetishizing and celebrating the very analytic objects it seeks to critique. In this talk, Professor Jasanoff will trace an arc from the attacks on scientific self-regulation of the 1970s to today’s seemingly greater acceptance of locating ethical responsibility within—not outside—the centers of innovation. She will reflect on ways in which the co-productionist framework enables a wider understanding of the scope and purposes of STS critique.Sheila Jasanoff is Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies at the Harvard Kennedy School. A pioneer in the social sciences, she explores the role of science and technology in the law, politics, and policy of modern democracies. Her books include The Fifth Branch, Science at the Bar, Designs on Nature, The Ethics of Invention, and Can Science Make Sense of Life? . She founded and directs the STS Program at Harvard, where she also formed the Science and Democracy Network; previously, she was founding chair of the STS Department at Cornell. In 2022, she received the Government of Norway’s Holberg Prize for law, humanities, and social sciences. Her other honors include the SSRC’s Hirschman prize, the Humboldt Foundation’s Reimar-Lüst award, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Jasanoff has held distinguished visiting professorships at leading universities in Europe, Asia, Australia, and the US. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, foreign member of the British Academy and the Royal Danish Academy, and member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She served on the AAAS Board of Directors and as President of the Society for Social Studies of Science.

The Ethics for Children Program (In Person Program for ages 6-16),"September 10, 2023, 11:00 AM","December 17, 2023, 12:30 PM","53 Prospect Park West, Brooklyn, NY 11215","Our Ethics for Children program offers a fun, safe, interactive learning environment for kids to explore important topics that affect their lives, fostering empathy and a deeper understanding of self and others. We use art, theatre, games, stories, music, discussion, reflection, and action to empower students to make a difference in their world.Our program does not impose a fixed set of values or beliefs. Rather our goal is to provide a forum where students can identify their own values, expand their knowledge and gain skills essential to developing and following their own moral compass and voice. This fall we will be expanding our programming; adding a third instructor so that we can support a greater age range of students. Our in-person classes will be held on Sundays at 11:00 at 50 Prospect Park West (Location may change, but will remain in the general area).In each class we feature one of the 5 major principles of our program: Care for the self, family, community, earth, and world. As the program year progresses, we customize the curriculum guided by student interest. Previous lessons have included topics such as rising sea levels, ableism, implicit bias, animal welfare, educational access & emotional self-care.Each month students of all ages come together to put ethics into action with a service project. Past projects have included stocking a local community fridge, making enrichment toys for shelter animals and hosting a family fun day for refugee families. Similar to our classes, service activities are influenced by student passion and interests.Not sure if this program will be a good fit for your learner? We encourage you to contact us with questions. Scholarships are available.Is the location inconvenient? We also offer a virtual hybrid program for ages 8-12.In-Person Classes are held on Sundays 11:00 – 12:30Price: $250 per semester (14 sessions)Growing Ethics (ages 6 - 9yo)Living Ethics (ages 10 - 12yo)Evolving Ethics (ages 13 and up)In Person Fall 2023 DatesSeptember, 10, 17, 24October 1, 8, 15, 22, 29November 5, 12, 19December 3, 10, 17",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/brooklyn-society-for-ethical-culture-194927004,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-ethics-for-children-program-in-person-program-for-ages-6-16-tickets-667287955237,True,NYC,/Users/raiidahmed/PycharmProjects/Event-Extractor-With-GUI/CSV_URL_DATA/AI Governance/AI_Governance_eventbrite_AI Ethics_NYC.csv

Honoring the Badge: Spotting and Avoiding Ethical Pitfalls,"September 11, 2023, 08:30 AM","September 11, 2023, 12:30 PM","214 Oldham Rd, Wayne, NJ 07470","Modern policing takes place in an ethical minefield – from the street to the courthouse, from management to recruiting, from training to on and off-duty conduct. The mission of the Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative at Drake University is to help agencies shape, enhance, and fortify their ethical culture and prevent misconduct from eroding confidence in the public sector. The highly acclaimed Honoring the Badge police ethics Agency and Command Staff programs take a deep dive into applied ethics and deal with the hidden and ignored ethical challenges within law enforcement. The course was created by world-renowned ethicist Michael Josephson and Detective Captain James Dugan. Jim, whose highly decorated NJ police career was derailed by one bad judgment, provides a unique, sobering, and inspiring perspective.This presentation addresses the following critical organizational needs:• The major causes of unethical behavior within a law enforcement agency. • The inherent career and officer wellness consequences of unethical behavior - long and short term. • The liability of ethical compromise from the legal and public support point of view. • The critical nature of ethical behavior as a “risk management” strategy. • The Six Pillars of Character® - applying them within your agency.About Jim Dugan, Lead Instructor: During his 13-year law enforcement career, Jim worked primarily in narcotic enforcement and police training. He received numerous awards and accommodations for his work and spoke at several state-wide law enforcement conferences throughout the northeast. He achieved the rank of Captain of Detectives at 32 when he was appointed Director of a New Jersey State Certified Police Training Academy. Unfortunately, Jim’s highly decorated police career ended abruptly in 1997 because of an unethical compromise.After a remarkably successful 25-year career in the private sector, Jim has now committed his time to educate and support the policing community by providing expert insights and resources that promote professional  development in the critical area of police ethics. Since its creation in 2019, the “Honoring the Badge” police ethics program has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from the law enforcement community and is now available for the training of entire police agencies and command staffs. This training is a POST Certified police ethics course in California and is presented in both recruit and in-service training programs.Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative at Drake UniversityThe Robert D. and Billie Ray Center at Drake University is home to the Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative, which provides character and leadership development strategies to improve civility and develop ethical leaders throughout the law enforcement community.To accomplish this, the Institute advocates five core principles: 	1. Place public interest over all other considerations including personal or private interests.	2. Make decisions on the merits, free from partiality, prejudice, or conflicts of interest.	3. Conduct police operations openly, efficiently, equitably, and honorably.	4. Observe the letter and spirit of the law.	5. Avoid appearances of impropriety or unethical conduct.Programs and ServicesWe offer a variety of approaches for ethics training that address specific agency needs and that are meaningful, measurable, and sustainable.

This is the world of competitive scholastic mariachi. This energetic documentary captures the highs and lows of Edinburg North High School’s Mariachi Oro, a green team, striving for state championship. With tough love, finely tuned empathy, and a fiery passion for the music, Coach Abel Acuña guides the varsity band through a steep competition season and a fraught year in their adolescent lives. Team captains Abby, Marlena, and Bella prove the value of the skills taught in the band room as they navigate life’s challenges on and off the stage with grace, immutable work ethic, and total charm.Filmmakers Alejandra Vasquez and Sam Osborn transport their audience to this symphonically, aesthetically, and emotionally vibrant world. A directorial debut for Vasquez and sophomore effort for Osborn, Going Varsity in Mariachi is a testament to their ability to explore identity, cultural roots, and pressing social issues with a nuance that foregrounds frankness, boldness, and joy.Presented in partnership with the New York City Economic Development Corporation and New York City Council Member Alexa Aviles!P﻿ERFORMERAcademia de Mariachi Nuevo AmanecerAcademia de Mariachi Nuevo Amanecer (AMNA) was founded in 2015.

Honoring the Badge: Spotting and Avoiding Ethical Pitfalls,"September 13, 2023, 08:30 AM","September 13, 2023, 12:30 PM","281 Campgaw Rd, Mahwah, NJ 07430","Every day, law enforcement personnel are presented with choices that can have long-term career consequences. Ethical behavior and decision-making are vital to the success and reputation of every law enforcement agency and the well-being of every officer. This presentation takes a deep dive into applied ethics and deals with hidden and ignored ethical challenges within law enforcement. The course was created by world-renowned ethicist Michael Josephson and Detective Captain James Dugan. Jim, whose highly decorated NJ police career was derailed by one bad judgment, provides a unique, sobering, and inspiring perspective. 
This presentation addresses the following critical organizational needs: 
• The major causes of unethical behavior within a law enforcement agency. 
• The inherent career and officer wellness consequences of unethical behavior - long and short term. 
• The liability of ethical compromise from the legal and public support point of view. 
• The critical nature of ethical behavior as a “risk management” strategy. 
• The Six Pillars of Character® - applying them within your agency.
About Jim Dugan, Lead Instructor: 
During his 13-year law enforcement career, Jim worked primarily in narcotic enforcement and police training. He received numerous awards and accommodations for his work and spoke at several state-wide law enforcement conferences throughout the northeast. He achieved the rank of Captain of Detectives at 32 when he was appointed Director of a New Jersey State Certified Police Training Academy. Unfortunately, Jim’s highly decorated police career ended abruptly in 1997 because of an unethical compromise. In this course, Jim takes you through the painful journey, both professionally and personally, that resulted from his conduct. 
Since then, Jim has had a very successful career in the private sector and now commits his time to educating and supporting the policing community. He provides expert insights and critical resources in police ethics professional development. 
Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative at Drake University: 
Modern policing takes place in an ethical minefield – from the street to the courthouse, from management to recruiting, from training to on and off-duty conduct. The Robert D. and Billie Ray Center at Drake University is home to the Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative, whose mission is to help agencies shape, enhance, and fortify their ethical culture and to prevent misconduct from eroding confidence in the public sector. 
To accomplish this, the Institute advocates five core principles: 
1. Place public interest over all other considerations including personal or private interests. 
2. Make decisions on the merits, free from partiality, prejudice, or conflicts of interest. 
3. Conduct police operations openly, efficiently, equitably, and honorably. 
4. Observe the letter and spirit of the law. 
5. Avoid appearances of impropriety or unethical conduct. 
Programs and Services 
We offer a variety of approaches for ethics training that address specific agency needs and that are meaningful, measurable, and sustainable. Contact us for more information on our Department and Command Staff Trainings, Agency Cultural Assessments and keynote presentations for conferences and trainings.

Honoring the Badge: Spotting and Avoiding Ethical Pitfalls,"September 15, 2023, 08:30 AM","September 15, 2023, 12:30 PM","2000 Kozloski Road, Freehold, NJ 07728","Every day, law enforcement personnel are presented with choices that can have long-term career consequences. Ethical behavior and decision-making are vital to the success and reputation of every law enforcement agency and the well-being of every officer. This presentation takes a deep dive into applied ethics and deals with hidden and ignored ethical challenges within law enforcement. The course was created by world-renowned ethicist Michael Josephson and Detective Captain James Dugan. Jim, whose highly decorated NJ police career was derailed by one bad judgment, provides a unique, sobering, and inspiring perspective. 
This presentation addresses the following critical organizational needs: 
• The major causes of unethical behavior within a law enforcement agency. 
• The inherent career and officer wellness consequences of unethical behavior - long and short term. 
• The liability of ethical compromise from the legal and public support point of view. 
• The critical nature of ethical behavior as a “risk management” strategy. 
• The Six Pillars of Character® - applying them within your agency.
About Jim Dugan, Lead Instructor: 
During his 13-year law enforcement career, Jim worked primarily in narcotic enforcement and police training. He received numerous awards and accommodations for his work and spoke at several state-wide law enforcement conferences throughout the northeast. He achieved the rank of Captain of Detectives at 32 when he was appointed Director of a New Jersey State Certified Police Training Academy. Unfortunately, Jim’s highly decorated police career ended abruptly in 1997 because of an unethical compromise. In this course, Jim takes you through the painful journey, both professionally and personally, that resulted from his conduct. 
Since then, Jim has had a very successful career in the private sector and now commits his time to educating and supporting the policing community. He provides expert insights and critical resources in police ethics professional development. 
Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative at Drake University: 
Modern policing takes place in an ethical minefield – from the street to the courthouse, from management to recruiting, from training to on and off-duty conduct. The Robert D. and Billie Ray Center at Drake University is home to the Josephson Exemplary Policing Initiative, whose mission is to help agencies shape, enhance, and fortify their ethical culture and to prevent misconduct from eroding confidence in the public sector. 
To accomplish this, the Institute advocates five core principles: 
1. Place public interest over all other considerations including personal or private interests. 
2. Make decisions on the merits, free from partiality, prejudice, or conflicts of interest. 
3. Conduct police operations openly, efficiently, equitably, and honorably. 
4. Observe the letter and spirit of the law. 
5. Avoid appearances of impropriety or unethical conduct. 
Programs and Services 
We offer a variety of approaches for ethics training that address specific agency needs and that are meaningful, measurable, and sustainable. Contact us for more information on our Department and Command Staff Trainings, Agency Cultural Assessments and keynote presentations for conferences and trainings.

The alleged dad will be hosting tonight!Show will feature our Main Event - the ALL-STAR TOURNAMENT OF PUN CHAMPIONS, where punsters deliver two-minute pun-stand-up routines, after only two minutes of preparation! PUNDERDOME® Champs and others will pun it out for ’Dome bragging rights and “As Seen on TV”-type prizes! And, that’s not all...We’ll play “Can You Beat a ’Dome Champ?” where a Challenger takes on a Punderdome® Champ in a one-on-one 2-minute PUN-OFF.  Challenger can opt to get topic 24 hours in advance and use any human and non-human resources (INCLUDING AI) in preparation; ‘Dome Champ gets no advance notice AND learns what topic is when the PUN-OFF begins! WINNER GETS UP TO $100!At the December 7, 2022 PUNDERDOME, Wall Street Journal reporter Ben Eisen challenged a PUNDERDOME Champ in “Can You Beat a ’Dome Champ?” and prepared by digesting four-hours of ChatGPT research.

Hearing protection gear recommended!Punderdome Reviews:GQ Magazine shouted the Punderdome® as one of the “5 Funniest Nights in America,” and quoted comedian Chris Gethard on why it’s great: “The crowd. You’d think you were at the Roman Colosseum. They’re passionate, to a level that feels dangerous. And to reiterate, this is a pun competition.”The New Yorker’s “Battle of Wits: A Report from the Punderdome”: “Can you imagine a more potent cure for the weekday blues? Here was concentrated, unabashed silliness that I longed to bottle and smuggle out in my purse.”Swing American: “The intellect on display is stunning. Hardly a pun is repeated throughout the entire night.
