01 Aug (Beijing, China)
04 Aug (Reutlingen, Germany)
05 Aug (Slovenia, Austria)

By looking at the dates from July to August 2023 alone, we can see that one of the extreme weather events—flash floods—had already happened all around the world with a higher frequency of occurrence and increasing severity.

To me, the root cause of climate change is easily predictable.
For the rest, the root-cause solution is nearly impossible to implement.

During my talk, I will analyze the cause and solution to climate change by using both a technical and philosophical approach so that you can understand climate change from different angles. I will show and prove my prediction that flash floods will continue to happen forever.

Do come and listen to my talk. It is open to anyone who is concerned about the environment, regardless of their background.

Youth leadership is real, and it is powerful. Putting them at the seat of change is needed now more than ever. While there is often a misconception that youths are apathetic or are disengaged around climate policy and decision making, this session’s panelists represent just a handful of examples that demonstrate that youths are actually highly engaged and want to be empowered to drive change. This panel discussion aims to highlight some of the work that youths in Singapore are doing to push for policy changes and for impactful action to be taken to protect the Earth and climate.    Moderator: Erin Gunanto, Programme Manager, EB Impact  Panelists: Muhd Nasry, Executive Director, Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity (SYVB)Rishika Selvan, Singapore Youth for Climate ActionAshleen Tan Su Ying, Coastal Ecologist, Surbana JurongLocation: ArtScience Cinema, Level 4For the full festival line-up, click HERE!Please note that there are limited seats to all talks.
