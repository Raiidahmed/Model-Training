This is an in-person event. Climate Cafes represent an opportunity to discuss difficult emotions that arise out of the climate crisis - everything from anxiety, fear, dread, hopelessness, and anger - in a supportive environment of peers. Climate Cafes are non-clinical, non-directive spaces where attendees can hold space for each others’ emotions without trying to fix other people. At it’s core, it can be meaningful to spend time with others who feel the same way.Participating in Climate Cafes can be cathartic for many who are aware of the ongoing climate emergency. It can break through the “business as usual” of daily life. Especially in local environments, it can be an opportunity to connect with neighbors or friends on ways to deepen our communities and increase our collective resiliency to the coming challenges.This event is open to all and nobody will be turned away for lack of funds. There is a suggested donation of $10 to cover snacks + location fees if you're able to. Any proceeds beyond break-even will be donated to GrowNYC and Earthjustice.

Thinking About Disability and Climate Change,"September 20, 2023, 01:30 PM","September 20, 2023, 03:00 PM","12 East 41st Street Room 701, New York, NY 10017","Disability must be addressed as an important part of climate policy because it is present in every race, sex, class, sexual preference, age, and everything else.  Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don’t understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ·	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ·	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ·	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ·	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,·	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right. Together, we can create a just, sustainable future for everyone.

Doors open at 1:30pm.WHERE: Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street in Manhattan between 5th and 6th Avenues. ""Where it Floods"" follows New York City students on the frontline of climate activism in Coney Island as they participate in RiSC, a climate education program that connects schools with local residents and organizations to help build community resilience.RSVP by September 15, 2023. S﻿pace is limited and seats will be assigned on a first come first served basis. How to Get to Quad CinemaThe climate crisis represents a significant threat to New York City’s 8.4 million inhabitants, including more than 1 million K-12 students. In the coming decades, more frequent extreme weather events, rising temperatures and extreme heat, changing precipitation, sea level rise, and the loss of land, homes, businesses, and lives will impact New York City. Our city’s young people understand this reality and want a meaningful education that prepares them for a climate altered future. Despite this, New York City students typically receive just 2 hours of climate instruction per school year on average.The National Wildlife Federation’s award-winning Resilient Schools Consortium (RiSC) program has been training teachers and educating students about climate science, climate impacts and resilience solutions since 2017.  NWF staff and partners have been working in Coney Island with local residents and community organizations since 2020 to help build both social and ecological resilience. Students from seven NYC middle and high schools learned about climate science, climate impacts, and the natural and built solutions that increase climate resiliency. They explored structural racism that caused inequitable exposures to climate risks, and used digital tools and surveys to understand their community's vulnerability to natural hazard risks like sea level rise and coastal erosion. By revegetating dunes along Coney Island’s shoreline, they learned how to help protect nearby residents’ homes from flooding. Most importantly students interviewed longtime Coney Islanders about their lived experiences with climate change and gentrification over time, and the persistent needs of their community that remains vulnerable to climate impacts 10 years after a major hurricane laid it to waste.F﻿or questions, contact nycresilientschools@gmail.comP﻿hoto: Alex Nawrocky for NWFFilm P﻿oster: Driven Studio",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/national-wildlife-federation-6391609253,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/where-it-floods-film-premiere-climate-week-2023-tickets-694922882047,NYC

We will also need to build close relationships with each other to support each other in our climate work and do so in a culture that systematically divides and separates us.Sustaining All Life calls this movement against a “normal” culture of conformity, passivity, overconsumption, isolation, and numbness “Mental Health Liberation.”In this workshop you will learn:·		 How normality is defined by the behaviors most desirable by profiteering interests;·		 How our societies and institutions enforce conformity and make people less likely to act against authority or resist oppression;·		 A Mental Health Liberation framework for understanding human upset beyond the medical (mental illness/mental health) and consumer models;·		 Practical tools for dealing with the emotions that come up when we face the climate emergency and challenge societal norms; and·		 A format for exchanging care with each other that creates the safety we need to show ourselves and build closer relationships.Understanding how our societies and institutions define and enforce normality is key to making the big changes we need to make.

As global leaders gather in New York for the UN Climate Ambition Summit and General Assembly, we are calling on governments to reckon with their role in fueling climate chaos, and harm against frontline communities and the planet  by continuing the extraction of fossil fuels . We only have a limited amount of years left to address and mitigate the worst impacts of the  climate crisis.For years, global climate movements have been calling for governments to phase out fossil fuels and stop expansion. We continue to pressure governments, corporations, and financial institutions to adhere to the demands of  science and communities, and implement an immediate equitable phaseout of fossil fuels. Instead, governments must invest in and deploy a Just Transition that is grounded in a climate justice framework and uplifts care economies, community-led solutions, Indigenous rights,  and a different vision than business as usual.During this event, we will host two panels, please see below for descriptions.“Women Ending the Era of Fossil Fuels”During this panel discussion, global women leaders will share expertise and frameworks for transitioning away from extraction and share ongoing policy advocacy and campaigns that seek to phase out fossil fuels, deforestation, and other harmful extractive practices. “Women-led Climate Solutions Are Central to a Just Transition and Thriving  Future”In the second panel we will hear from  global women leaders and policy experts on how to implement and support  solutions that are advancing  a Just Transition. Speakers will share demonstrated successes of women’s leadership in implementing just community-led climate solutions. ------------------------------------------------------------Registration informationRegistration is required.

It has contributed to causing the climate crisis and interferes with our efforts to solve it. It shapes and perpetuates the inequities of our society. It has become part of our social institutions. Unless we address racism, it is replicated in any climate solutions we develop. Yet we can reach for each other and build an united front to tackle the climate crisis together—with renewed energy, collaboration and success. Understanding and healing the effects of racism is a necessary step in creating a movement that can sustain all life and restore the environment. We can act now-- interrupting racism in our daily lives, taking leadership, forming deep relationships across racial lines, removing racism from our societies’ institutions, teaching tools for recovery from the harm done to individuals by racism, and supporting the work of other individuals and organizations in ending racism.

As social and ecological crises escalate globally, it is clear that the dominant cultural worldview, informed by colonization, patriarchy, capitalism, and racism is displaying a relationship with Nature and each other that is devastatingly unjust and out of balance. To live in a healthy and equitable world, we must fundamentally change how we respect and interact with the Earth and one another. To change the present and future, it is imperative to change the narrative and amplify worldviews and stories of climate justice solutions that transform the dominant worldview from an extractivist, colonial paradigm of “exploit and extract” to a sustainable, globally-conscious one of “respect and restore.”At this event, movement leaders and change-makers will weave together stories, worldviews, and experiences of restoration and justice that demonstrate the healthy and equitable world we know is possible and needed. We knew in our bones this time was coming, and now we must act in solidarity more than ever, continuing to build a powerful movement founded on principles of justice, love, and a fierce dedication to our planet and our communities.This event is also the pre-launch of the forthcoming book by Osprey Orielle Lake, ""The Story is in Our Bones: How Worldviews and Climate Justice Can Remake a World in Crisis,"" to be released in January 2024.

Steven is a leading thinker operating at the intersection of climate, law, and corporate power, and is the first US attorney to be jailed by a corporation in retaliation for his human rights work.After helping Amazon communities win a historic $9.5 billion pollution judgment against Chevron, the company retaliated and prosecuted him for contempt of court in New York after he refused to turn his computer and confidential case file over to his adversary counsel. The federal prosecutor rejected the charges, which were filed by a pro-corporate judge with financial ties to the company.The judge appointed a Chevron law firm to prosecute Steven in the name of the US government.The private Chevron prosecutor immediately ordered Steven locked up at home with a 24/7 monitoring device on his ankle, while his trial was delayed for over two years. He ended up spending 993 days in detention and in prison for a misdemeanor offense with a maximum sentence of 180 days; the judge denied him a jury.He is still the only person ever in the US locked up in retaliation for his human rights work. Chevron used 60 law firms and 2,000 lawyers to attack Steven.

"Kristina Lunz and Enuma Okoro on Foreign Policy, Climate, and Feminism","September 21, 2023, 07:00 PM","September 21, 2023, 08:30 PM","1014 5th Avenue, New York, NY 10028","Two days after the UN General Assembly in New York City, 1014 presents Financial Times columnist Enuma Okoro and Kristina Lunz, co-founder of the Centre for Feminist Foreign Policy, in conversation about our chances to improve global climate policy and create a more caring international order. They will discuss feminist foreign policy and the accelerating climate crisis with each other and the audience.

Kristina Lunz will give insights into her latest book “The Future of Foreign Policy is Feminist”, which will be published in English later this year. While the book is not yet available in the United States, three copies will be raffled to the audience during the event.Kristina Lunz and her ""Centre for Feminist Foreign Policy"" are trying to change that. The political scientist, activist and entrepreneur thinks peace, human rights and justice together with foreign policy and wants to initiate a paradigm shift: She counters power play and military muscle games with mediation in peace negotiations, feminist power analyses and climate justice. Realpolitik is exchanged for utopias, and there are just as many women ambassadors as ambassadors. In this way, the antagonism of nations can finally be replaced, and everyone will be able to live in greater security and with fewer conflicts.Enuma Okoro is a Nigerian-American author, journalist, lecturer, and cultural curator. She is a weekly columnist for the Financial Times weekend newspaper. Her column, “The Art of Life,” reflects on the intersection of art, philosophy, spirituality, culture and how we live. Her broader research and writing interests include considering how the arts, intersectional feminism, philosophy, language and knowledge theory, theology and contemplative eco-spirituality speak into the study of the human condition, how we relate to the more-than-human, and how we accumulate and produce knowledge. 

She is convinced that stories, through their varying mediums, are how we challenge old narratives, free our imaginations, and tell new and expanded truths that shift perceptions and instigate change.VENUE ACCESSIBILITY

After the talk, Nick will sign copies of his book.RESERVE YOUR SIGNED COPY OF THE GREAT TRANSITIONAVAILABLE TO SHIP MOST PLACESP﻿RAISE FOR THE GREAT TRANSITION“Hopeful, bold, imaginative, and heartbreaking, The Great Transition lucidly shows the incredible capacity of utopian thinking to inspire and change lives, while addressing the devastating costs of climate inaction. I can’t stop thinking about this visionary novel and its singular characters. Nick Fuller Googins has written a book for the present and the future — read this and you will be changed.” — Michelle Min Sterling, New York Times bestselling author of Camp Zero“A magnificent debut novel that’s both an important cautionary tale and a deeply compelling family story. Although set in a stunningly well-imagined future in the aftermath of a climate apocalypse, The Great Transition is electrifyingly relevant.” — William Kent Krueger, New York Times bestselling author of This Tender Land“[The Great Transition] melds the huge and the intimate, the imperatives of our global climate crisis with the more compact narrative of a family trying to do right by one another when the world goes sideways. Fuller-Googins stares down some of today's biggest societal issues with abundant imagination and endless empathy.” — Emily Nemens, author of The Cactus League“Nick Fuller Googins demonstrates exactly the kind of clear-eyed utopian thinking we’ll need more of as we work together to solve our climate crisis, wrapping a call to action, accountability, and mutual aid in a story that’s as thrilling as it is moving. Every worthwhile novel sets out to change its reader—this one sets out to change the world. I hope it does.” — Matt Bell, author of Appleseed“The Great Transition asks what it means to start over — as a society and as individuals — and then answers with visionary scope. Offering readers thrilling glimpses into utopic possibilities born from collective mobilization, as well as an unflinching assessment of our climate crisis, Nick Fuller Googins brilliantly renders the personal political and the political personal.” — Allegra Hyde, author of EleutheriaRESERVE YOUR SIGNED COPY OF THE GREAT TRANSITIONAVAILABLE TO SHIP MOST PLACESEmi Vargas, whose parents helped save the world, is tired of being told how lucky she is to have been born after the climate crisis. But following the public assassination of a dozen climate criminals, Emi’s mother, Kristina, disappears as a possible suspect, and Emi’s illusions of utopia are shattered. A determined Emi and her father, Larch, journey from their home in Nuuk, Greenland to New York City, now a lightly populated storm-surge outpost built from the ruins of the former metropolis. But they aren’t the only ones looking for Kristina.Thirty years earlier, Larch first came to New York with a team of volunteers to save the city from rising waters and torrential storms. Kristina was on the frontlines of a different battle, fighting massive wildfires that ravaged the western United States. They became part of a movement that changed the world­—The Great Transition—forging a new society and finding each other in process.Alternating between Emi’s desperate search for her mother and a meticulously rendered, heart-stopping account of her parents’ experiences during The Great Transition, this novel beautifully shows how our actions today determine our fate tomorrow. A triumphant debut, The Great Transition is a breathtaking rendering of our near future, told through the story of one family trying to protect each other and the place we all call home.This is a free in-store event with limited amphitheater-style seatingWe encourage all guests to wear masks.The talk will be followed by a book signing. Books signed at P&T Knitwear events must be purchased from P&T Knitwear. If you would like a signed copy and cannot attend the event, we're happy to take your pre-order.

Sharkswimmer, Climates + more","September 06, 2023, 09:00 PM","September 07, 2023, 11:30 PM","1272 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY 11221","8﻿:00PM Doors // 9:00PM Show2﻿1+$﻿12 adv // $15 dosS﻿harkswimmerWith guitar music arguably in its most creatively rich period in at least two decades, bands are at long last reclaiming the sense of identity that made rock such a potent force in the first place. Fittingly, Brooklyn, NY quartet Sharkswimmer has identity in abundance, and their unique brand of introspective, melodic post-hardcore informed alt-rock is a worthy entry into the emerging canon.On their debut LP and first release for Really Rad Records, Serenity, Sharkswimmer calls forth the aggressive melodicism of 90s post-hardcore greats like Planes Mistaken For Stars, the hook-heavy punch of 2010s alt-rock acts such as Basement, and the gritty emotional vulnerability of contemporaries like Fiddlehead for a stunning full-length effort that is dripping with personality. Written over several months and recorded with producer/engineer Jon Markson (Drug Church, Koyo, Soul Blind), Serenity is, at its core, a remarkably well-crafted alt-rock record with bursts of aggression that befit the band’s DIY roots. Disarmingly earnest lyricism that evokes the most heart-wrenching ballads of 90s emo serves as a perfect counterbalance to the record’s sonic aggression, anchoring it to the humanity that makes up the record’s spiritual center. Largely a vehicle for vocalist/guitarist and principle songwriter Justin Buschardt to exercise the emotional trauma of divorce, Serenity explores the universality of heartbreak against a backdrop of anthemic, guitar-driven tracks that would be as at home on the Jade Tree catalogue of the 90s as they are next to contemporary acts such as Drug Church or Militarie Gun.As rich as the current rock landscape is, it could just as easily be overcome with cheap imitations and pretenders. Luckily, Sharkswimmer is here to ensure that doesn’t happen. With a healthy portion of pathos and pop hooks, Serenity is an immediately arresting affair that secures the band’s status as well-deserving heirs to the alt-rock throne. E﻿xtra SpecialExtra Special is the indie pop/rock solo moniker of Amelia Bushell (Belle Mare, Grim Streaker). Formed in Brooklyn, NY in 2019, the project aims to tell stories of love, heartache, poor choices, and the hardships of young adulthood in a vulnerable, blunt and often humorous way.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-broadway-20150099203,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bands-do-bk-the-book-bday-bash-ft-sharkswimmer-climates-more-tickets-694237883197,NYC
