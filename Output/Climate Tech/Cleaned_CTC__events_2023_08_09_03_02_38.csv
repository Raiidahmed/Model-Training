In this talk, I will introduce the effort of developing faster and better representation of aerosol and aerosol-cloud interactions for a next-generation Earth system model by improving physics, increasing resolution, and utilizing machine learning techniques. In this effort, we have generated hundreds of terabytes of data that consists of process model, large-eddy, convection-permitting, and climate-scale perturbed physics simulations to train ML models. These ML models are used as new parameterizations in an Earth system model representing aerosol radiative properties, droplet nucleation, warm rain processes, and cloud adjustments, and as new diagnostic tools to reveal causal links between aerosol and the intricate Earth system. I will discuss our progress as well as challenges we encountered when integrating the ML models in the Earth system model.",Speaker: Po-Lun Ma,https://www.climate.columbia.edu/events/improving-aerosol-earth-system-model-aiml,NYC

Libraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment,"August 19, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 19, 2023, 06:00 PM","1000 Burgemeester Brokxlaan, 5041 SG Tilburg, Netherlands","The IFLA Environment, Sustainability and Libraries Section (ENSULIB) together with the Public Libraries Section (PLS) in collaboration with Bibliotheek Midden-Brabant, LocHal are organising a satellite conference prior to the IFLA World Library and Information Congress 2023 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The focus will be on “Libraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment”. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans. With a mix of keynotes, lightning talks and workshops, it will be an interactive, engaging and inspiring day. Programme9.00 – Registration & Coffee9.30 –  Keynote:  Ton van Vlimmeren (Netherlands) – Libraries Building Sustainable CommunitiesTon van Vlimmeren is the President of the European Library Organization (EBLIDA), member of the Standing Committee of the Metropolitan Libraries Section of IFLA and one of the founders of Public Libraries 2030. This keynote will highlight how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help libraries on their journey towards a sustainable, inclusive, and democratic society10.20 – Lightning Talks: STRATEGIES & CHALLENGES: IMPLEMENTING SDGS IN LIBRARIESMinna Männikkö (Finland) – Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap: Climate Action in Oulu, Finland In 2020, Oulu City Library implemented a Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap. Based on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap defines key development areas and sets out implementation plans. It focuses on promoting environmental awareness, reducing environmental impact and responsible construction, with the aim that sustainable development permeates all areas of the library’s daily work. This presentation will outline the roadmap and how it is being used as a long-term tool for climate action in Oulu City Library in Finland.Sarah Tribelhorn (USA) – Bringing the SDGs Alive in an Academic LibraryThe San Diego State University Library has mapped its work to the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of employee roles, projects, and the library website. The process culminated in an exhibition that led to an engaging community discussion and challenged students, staff, and faculty to think critically about how they can contribute to these goals. This presentation will describe the process as a catalyst for community engagement, partnerships, and empowerment around climate awareness and the SDGs.Nathalice Bezerra Cardoso (Brazil) – Challenges of the SDGs: Case Study of the German LibrariesThe SDGs have gained prominence in recent years, and there has been increased discussion on the role and social responsibilities of libraries regarding this issue. This presentation will provide an understanding of how German libraries are contributing to the SDGs. Do the people who are working in the libraries know what the SDGs are about?? Which SDGs are addressed by German public libraries? What services and actions are being developed in German libraries to achieve the SDGs?11.00 –  Coffee Break 11.30 – Workshops Workshop 1: Beth Filar Williams (USA) – Inner Development Goals: A Collaborative Exploration WorkshopThe Inner Development Goals (IDGs) are a framework for accelerating our work towards the SDGs, co-created by diverse, international experts in response to current crises. The IDGs can help us access the deep level beneath the structures so that we can work on ourselves and how we relate to others, care for the world and create change. Participants will be invited to explore this framework in small groups – shifting awareness, connecting with each other and the earth. Workshop 2: Liselotte Dessauvagie (Netherlands) – SDGs Bookclub: For a Better Future!An SDGs Bookclub is an annotated list of selected books that teachers and librarians can use to discuss and explore the SDGs with children (and adults). Suggestions for teaching will accompany the book selection. In this workshop, the Dutch version of the SDGs Bookclub will be presented and the selection will be discussed. Participants will work on a small SDGs Bookclub during the session and explore how the SDGs can help build a better future for all through books.Workshop 3: Daniel Hackborn (Canada) – MACK Framework: Situating Climate Action in Local Library ContextsWhile anthropogenic global warming is inherently a global issue demanding systemic action, developing responses at a local institutional level can be overwhelming. In this workshop, we will introduce the Mitigation-Adaptation-Community-Knowledge (MACK) conceptual model and, using Amiskwaciwâskahikan (Edmonton), Canada as a guiding case study, illustrate how this model can be applied to other local libraries in order to clarify and analyse their potential opportunities for climate action.12.30 – Lunch Break (included in registration) 13.30 –  Keynote: Jantien Borsboom, Pieternel Thijssen (Netherlands) – Community participation in the SDGsSince 2016, the SDGs have been a framework for the library of Midden-Brabant. In this keynote, we will tell the story of how the SDGs became a guiding principle for the library. They are now one of the four impact chains. The library of Midden-Brabant has developed a method to work with communities on societal issues, such as the SDGs. We will share how the LocHal library worked offline and online with the community around urban nature, reaching more than 25,000 people.14.10 – Lighting Talks and Workshop: INSPIRE & EMPOWER: EXAMPLES ACROSS THE GLOBEPriscilla Pun (China) – 10 Ways to Make Your Library Green This presentation will provide examples of libraries as actors and educators for sustainable development, in line with ENSULIB’s definition of a Green Library. Examples include creating and promoting shared resources or facilities (sharing economy), reducing consumption, using environmentally friendly library buildings and equipment, and demonstrating commitment to international environmental goals and programmes.Tim Schumann (Germany) – The Berlin-Pankow Public Library Going Green The Berlin-Pankow Public Library is on its way to become a Green Library by embracing its role as an actor in an ecologically and socially sustainable future. This presentation will describe current measures of the library in terms of diversity, management, and partnerships, becoming a third place in the community, and how this relates to its goal of becoming a Green Library.Workshop: Helena Öberg Carlsson (Sweden) – Transition Stories Beyond Dystopia and Carbon RuinsThrough storytelling and sharing experiences, we can foster a sense of belonging and collective agency for change. This workshop is based on a scientific master narrative that has been used as a spinning wheel for a dynamic process involving public libraries in Västmanland County, Lund University, artists and local stakeholders, where it has initiated a process to reveal the potential of public libraries as arenas for transition and change.15.30 – Coffee Break15.50 – Panel Discussion and Closing:  CLIMATE ACTION: COUNT LIBRARIES IN!A panel of library leaders from around the world will come together to share and discuss the role of libraries as actors of climate empowerment.16.30 – Self-guided Tour of LocHal and Social GatheringM﻿ore information can be found on our website:https://www.ifla.org/events/ifla-wlic-satellite-meeting-2023-libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment/ ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/bibliotheek-midden-brabant-and-ensulib-pls-64783058103,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment-tickets-623591016517,Amsterdam

The initiative also seeks narratives that center solutions from the communities most impacted by the climate crisis, and stories that are rooted in cultural authenticity (a deep sense of place, customs, cuisine, and more) and rich subcultures that uplift traditions not often seen in mainstream literature. Over the course of three years the project has encouraged 3,000 plus writers from 91 countries to submit stories, and of which 700,000 people have read. Writers and readers alike will enjoy this climate justice romp.About the Speaker:Tory Stephens creates opportunities that transform organizations and shift culture. He is a resource generator and community builder for social justice issues, people, and movements. He currently works at Grist Magazine as their climate fiction creative manager, and uses storytelling to champion climate justice, and imagine green, clean, and just futures. In another life he owned a kick-butt streetwear company, and he would have gotten away with eating the last cookie too, if it weren't for his three meddling kids.N﻿ote: This program will NOT be recorded.

How do we navigate this new age of extremes? In A Traveler's Guide to the End of the World, David Gessner takes readers on an eye-opening tour of climate hotspots from the Gulf of Mexico to the burning American West to New York City to the fragile Outer Banks, where homes are being swallowed by the seas. He does so with his usual sense of humor, compassion, and a willingness to talk to anyone, providing an informative and sobering yet convivial guide for the age of fire, heat, wind, and water.Gessner approaches scientists and thinkers with a father's question: What will the world be like in forty-two years? Gessner was forty-two when his daughter, Hadley, was born. What will the world be like in 2064, when Hadley is his age now? What is the future of weather? The future of heat, storms, and fire? What exactly will our children be facing? A Traveler's Guide to the End of the World tells a story of climate crisis that will both entertain and shake people awake to the necessity of navigating this new age together.David Gessner is the author of Quiet Desperation, Savage Delight: Sheltering with Thoreau in the Age of Crisis, Leave It As It Is: A Journey Through Theodore Roosevelt’s American Wilderness, and the New York Times–bestselling All the Wild That Remains: Edward Abbey, Wallace Stegner and the American West. Chair of the Creative Writing Department at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and founder and editor-in-chief of Ecotone, Gessner lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, with his wife, the novelist Nina de Gramont, and their daughter, Hadley.Nina de Gramont’s latest novel, The Christie Affair, is an international and New York Times bestseller, and the Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick for February, 2022. The Christie Affair has been translated into more than twenty languages. Nina is also the author of a collection of short stories, as well as the novels Gossip of the Starlings and The Last September. She has written several YA novels (Every Little Thing in the World, Meet Me at the River, The Boy I Love, and — under the pen name Marina Gessner — The Distance From Me to You). Nina teaches creative writing at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. She lives with her daughter, her dog Isabelle, and her husband, the writer David Gessner.

But following the public assassination of a dozen climate criminals, Emi’s mother, Kristina, disappears as a possible suspect, and Emi’s illusions of utopia are shattered. A determined Emi and her father, Larch, journey from their home in Nuuk, Greenland to New York City, now a lightly populated storm-surge outpost built from the ruins of the former metropolis. But they aren’t the only ones looking for Kristina.Thirty years earlier, Larch first came to New York with a team of volunteers to save the city from rising waters and torrential storms. Kristina was on the frontlines of a different battle, fighting massive wildfires that ravaged the western United States. They became part of a movement that changed the world­—The Great Transition—forging a new society and finding each other in process.Alternating between Emi’s desperate search for her mother and a meticulously rendered, heart-stopping account of her parents’ experiences during The Great Transition, this novel beautifully shows how our actions today determine our fate tomorrow. A triumphant debut, The Great Transition is a breathtaking rendering of our near future, told through the story of one family trying to protect each other and the place we all call home.Nick Fuller Googins has published short stories and essays in The Paris Review, the Los Angeles Times, The Southern Review, and elsewhere. He lives in Maine, and works as an elementary school teacher. The Great Transition is his first novel.Moderator Miriam Wasser is a senior reporter with WBUR's climate and environment team.

He previously served at US universities including Tennessee, Duke and Yale. He is founder and volunteer director of the Palestine Institute for Biodiversity and Sustainability (PIBS) at Bethlehem University (http://palestinenature.org). Qumsiyeh published over 170 scientific papers, over 30 book chapters, hundreds of articles, and several books on topics ranging from cultural heritage to human rights to biodiversity conservation to cancer. He oversaw a number of projects ranging from formulating the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan to empowerment projects with farmers, women, and children that benefitted tens of thousands. He is laureate of the Paul K. Feyerabend Foundation award the Takreem award among others. See also http://qumsiyeh.orgHow do we find hope when events and news are of oppression and repression and the global environmental nakba (catastrophe)? Our earth faces climate change, habitat destruction, pollution, invasive species, overexploitation, rampant inequality, and wars/conflict. How are we to ensure sustainable human and natural communities against all odds? Palestine is the Western part of the Fertile Crescent where humans first developed agriculture. This is why this part of Western Asia was the cradle of civilizations and monotheistic religions. Can this geographic spot generate modules of sustainability in the bleakest of conditions? Can these models be applicable to other countries? These and other questions are addressed.Qumsiyeh is accompanied by his wife Jessie Chang, a co-founder and co-director and volunteer director at the institute. Both donated their money and are full time volunteers at the institute. The event helps to raise awareness and garner support of all types (money, expertise, networking, volunteers etc) to our institute and environmental/sustainability work in Palestine.Please register for this FREE program.

In California Against the Sea, Los Angeles Times coastal reporter Rosanna Xia asks: As climate chaos threatens the places we love so fiercely, will we finally grasp our collective capacity for change?Xia, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, investigates the impacts of engineered landscapes, the market pressures of development, and the ecological activism and political scrimmages that have carved our contemporary coastline--and foretell even greater changes to our shores. From the beaches of the Mexican border up to the sheer-cliffed North Coast, the voices of Indigenous leaders, community activists, small-town mayors, urban engineers, and tenacious environmental scientists commingle. Together, they chronicle the challenges and urgency of forging a climate-wise future. Xia's investigation takes us to Imperial Beach, Los Angeles, Pacifica, Marin City, San Francisco, and beyond, weighing the rivaling arguments, agreements, compromises, and visions governing the State of California's commitment to a coast for all. Through graceful reportage, she charts how the decisions we make today will determine where we go tomorrow: headlong into natural disaster, or toward an equitable refashioning of coastal stewardship. Rosanna Xia is an environmental reporter for the Los Angeles Times, where she specializes in stories about the coast and ocean. She was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2020 for explanatory reporting on sea level rise, which inspired the work that culminated in California Against the Sea. Her writing has been anthologized in the Best American Science and Nature Writing series.Moderator Kerri Arsenault is a literary critic, co-director of The Environmental Storytelling Studio at Brown University, contributing editor at Orion magazine, and author of Mill Town: Reckoning with What Remains. Her writing has been published in The Boston Globe, Paris Review, New York Review of Books, Washington Post, and New York Times.About Brookline BooksmithWe are one of New England’s premier independent bookstores, family-owned and locally run since 1961.

"Housing with HEART: A Study, a Vision, a Call to Action","September 07, 2023, 04:00 PM","September 07, 2023, 07:00 PM","20 Franklin Street, Worcester, MA 01608","The Worcester H.E.A.R.T. Partnership, led by the Worcester Branch NAACP, will share lessons learned from our year-long study of equity-centered upgrades to Worcester’s old triple-deckers. In addition to sharing what we’ve learned, we invite residents to help us envision pathways forward by telling their own housing stories at interactive installations.Our story starts with the importance of building upgrades for the health, safety, and comfort of Worcester residents as well as essential climate benefits.  Our storytelling is based on a study focused on triple deckers owned by the Main South Community Development Corporation, but it has implications for all our triple deckers. Of course, the challenges to upgrading these properties without displacing residents will vary depending in large part on whether they are owned by a non-profit, a private developer, or owner occupied. We begin to map out the funding, regulatory, and programmatic challenges and opportunities for these different ownership categories.The story we tell is fundamentally incomplete without lessons learned from the people who live in the buildings that need to be upgraded. With the help of the Creative Hub, the PopUp event will include several large installations that include materials and suggested prompts for attendees to tell their own housing stories—where they live, what kind of house they live in, what they love about their home and what changes to their housing would make them love it more. This will be an English-Spanish bilingual event with Spanish language interpreters onsite.……………………………………..The Worcester Healthy, Equitable, Affordable Retrofits & Training (H.E.A.R.T.)  Partnership was funded from the MA Clean Energy Center EmPower program and RMI.Framework for the study was based on the National NAACP program Centering Equity in the Sustainable Building Sector Program.Description of the study below was taken from the MA CEC EmPower Program websiteWorcester H.E.A.R.T. was launched by the Climate & Environmental Justice (C&EJ) Committee of the Worcester NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in order to improve the health, safety, and energy efficiency of triple deckers owned by the Main South Community Development Corporation (MSCDC), recommend pathways to electrification, and support the development of a local workforce that is prepared to benefit from jobs created in a growing green home performance industry.  Member organizations of Worcester HEART include: Main South CDC, which selected six of its properties for the pilot and serves as the fiscal sponsor; Sustainable Comfort (SCI) an agency that designs, builds, and consults on green buildings;Resonant Energy, a company with a mission to use solar PV projects in underinvested communities to build wealth;  Worcester Community Action Council, a CAP agency that helps people move to economic self-sufficiency through programs, partnerships, and advocacy; NAACP C&EJ Committee;Mothers Out Front Worcester an organization that addresses gas leaks and climate change with caregivers, mothers, and grandmothers at the forefront;  Neighbor to Neighbor Worcester, an organization building community power to confront income inequality, environmental degradation, and racism;   RMI, an organization catalyzing rapid, market-based change in the global energy system to secure a prosperous zero-carbon future for all, which has supported Worcester HEART with supplemental funding and guidance as needed;Building Retrofit Study, Workforce Development, and Stakeholder Engagement With the Innovation and Capacity Building Grant, which awards funding to explore new projects or programs and build community and organizational capacity, the project team aims to lay the groundwork for a model of triple decker retrofits with pathways to electrification, and to approach this challenge holistically, centering people who live in the buildings. Forty-six percent (46%) of people living in Worcester are renters (tenants), who historically have limited access to the programs and resources available to owners to make upgrades to their homes. Worcester HEART prioritizes the concerns of tenants such as permanent affordability, the cost of energy, linguistically accessible and culturally relevant materials and messaging, and access to the economic opportunities anticipated in a decarbonizing economy. To develop a holistic model of triple-decker retrofits, Worcester HEART is organized into three teams, working on three fronts: studying the six buildings for energy savings and decarbonization, assessing the workforce landscape, and engaging with tenants.Activity in 2022 Retrofit Study Team: SCI and MSCDC collected historical utility data for both power consumption and natural gas; SCI conducted in-home audits with members of the Tenant Engagement Team and completed energy modeling of the different properties based on building enclosure, mechanical systems, and lighting and appliances in apartment units and common areas. The report inventories 18 different energy conservation measures and includes costs and energy savings and health and other benefits based on specified assumptions. Resonant Energy completed an analysis of solar potential on all 6 properties. The final report will integrate potential savings from solar energy as well as incentives and rebates.  Workforce Development Team: The team consulted with  Phil Jordan, an expert on workforce development, who provided feedback and an analysis of the energy efficiency workforce development landscape. The team met with policy experts and job training providers including MassHire, the Green Jobs Academy, and workforce development administrators at Quinsigamond Community College, to identify existing and possible training classes for occupations needed as building retrofits ramp up. The team summarized research on the emerging energy efficiency workforce landscape and disseminated it to potential partners. Both the Worcester Jobs Fund (Mass Hire) and the Green Jobs Academy attended a Worcester HEART outreach event and confirmed interest in collaborating on grants to prepare a local workforce for building retrofits. Tenant Engagement Team: In March 2022, the team organized and facilitated a Spanish and English virtual information session for interested tenants of the properties selected for the pilot to explain project activities and purpose and answer any questions. They developed bilingual outreach materials and designed the Worcester HEART logo. Team members conducted one-on-one conversations with interested tenants to further explain the project and invite deeper engagement with project activities. The tenants in one apartment participated in organizing a July block party with broader outreach to tenants and low-income homeowners. The facilitated, information-packed block party offered free food, music, and children’s activities, Spanish language interpretation, and information on energy efficiency and housing support services as well as job and job training opportunities. The event was covered by Spectrum television.Worcester HEART was also featured by the Worcester Telegram & Gazette in a recent article  titled “Big Changes Could be in Store for Nearly 5,000 Three-Deckers in Worcester.” This article highlights the important work of the Worcester HEART Partnership: Taking steps to move buildings away from fossil fuels and making them electric is important for the climate and the health and safety of people living in those buildings. The article noted that the city will use the results of the pilot to inform efforts to upgrade the thousands of triple deckers in Worcester. A follow-up article titled, “Job boost for low-income people in Worcester? Climate bill could do it,” focuses on the potential economic benefits of the Massachusetts “Next Generation” climate bill to low-income communities and highlights the research of the Worcester HEART Partnership",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/worcester-heart-partnership-69247904773,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/housing-with-heart-a-study-a-vision-a-call-to-action-tickets-689507053157,Boston

About the Alnoba Peace Foundation
A world in need of healing
From climate change to the impact of technology on our minds and the economy, our world is in crisis. A winner-take-all society isolates us from each other and from the earth that sustains us. Our communities are broken, consumption and waste run rampant, and we are severed from the healing power of the natural world.
Both we and the world need a change. Start that change on the inside. You can overcome the harmful and destructive patterns imposed on you by this broken world we’re living in, opening to a more natural and authentic way of engaging with yourself and our planet.
The power to change
There are both ancient and pioneering tools you can use to rewrite your patterns, breaking free of the old way of thinking and being as you tap into something stronger: a way of living that connects us harmoniously to both each other and the earth we share.
Manny Muros has spent decades studying, practicing and sharing the spiritual techniques that lead to greater self-awareness and self-realization. His wisdom teachings are insights gained through a lifetime of deep practice and exploration. Through meditation and affirmative practices, he teaches students how to center, deconstruct old patterns and recover a truer way of being.
The sacred land of Alnoba, with its pristine fields and forests and inspiring collection of outdoor art, serves as a potent space for undertaking this journey of transformation.
Be the difference
To use the ancient words of wisdom: as it is above, so it is below. The world we cultivate inside ourselves makes a real impact on the one that surrounds us. By changing one, we impact the other.
Step forward into your own change, breaking free of a paradigm that destroys both our well-being and that of our planet. Discover a healthier, more authentic alternative that empowers you to be the change you seek.

Annual Harvest Supper Celebration,"August 26, 2023, 04:00 PM","August 26, 2023, 07:00 PM","14 Court Square, Greenfield, MA 01301","The Annual Harvest Supper Celebration will take place on the Greenfield Common on Saturday, August 26st from 4-7 PM


Contact:  Kirsten Levitt, info@thestonesoupcafe.org, 413-475-0072 

Join Stone Soup Café for our Annual Harvest Supper Celebration on Saturday, August 26, from 4-7PM on the Greenfield Town Common. The Harvest Supper is open to everyone in the community, based on the Cafe’s pay-what-you-can model. Swing by for delicious food, music, art, tie-dye, and a “Really Really Free Store.” People are encouraged to bring their own plates, cups, and utensils to cut down on waste.


The rain date will be Sunday, August 27th at the same time and location.


The Harvest Supper is an annual event celebrating local food, farms, and community. Every August, the town comes together to share the farmers’ bountiful harvest with the community. Farmers and talented chefs donate their time and produce to create an amazing meal that is served to 800+ people every year. 


With the climate crisis happening around us, we need to celebrate and support our farms and farmers more than ever. Over the past 17 years we’ve received nearly 100% of the food and products as donations. This year we intend to pay our farmers as a way to give back to a community that has been hard hit with both drought and flooding that are affecting the harvests and the economic prospects of these farmers. We pledge further to spotlight these local producers on our social media as part of marketing the event. Contact us at info@thestonesoupcafe.org to sponsor the event.


The Harvest Supper was started in 2005 by Juanita Nelson, an ardent pacifist, war tax resister, civil rights activist, and supporter of local, organic agriculture. Nelson encouraged people to grow their own food and to support local farming as part of the local economy, which she said was an expression of nonviolence.

Stone Soup is looking for over 100 volunteers to help make the supper a success. You can sign up for a volunteer shift on Stone Soup’s website: www.thestonesoupcafe.org.

We’ve come a long way since then. Now, fine-dining restaurants like Eleven Madison Park cater to chic upscale clientele with a plant-based menu, and Impossible Whoppers are available at Burger King. But can plant-based food keep its historical anti-capitalist energies if it goes mainstream? And does it need to?In No Meat Required, author Alicia Kennedy chronicles the fascinating history of plant-based eating in the United States, from the early experiments in tempeh production undertaken by the Farm commune in the 70s to the vegan punk cafes and anarchist zines of the 90s to the chefs and food writers seeking to decolonize vegetarian food today.Many people become vegans because they are concerned about the role capitalist food systems play in climate change, inequality, white supremacy, and environmental and cultural degradation. But a world where Walmart sells frozen vegan pizzas and non-dairy pints of ice cream are available at gas stations – raises distinct questions about the meanings and goals of plant-based eating.Kennedy—a vegetarian, former vegan, and once-proprietor of a vegan bakery—understands how to present this history with sympathy, knowledge, and humor. No Meat Required brings much-needed depth and context to our understanding of vegan and vegetarian cuisine, and makes a passionate argument for retaining its radical heart.A﻿BOUT ALICIA KENNEDY Alicia Kennedy is a writer based in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her weekly newsletter on food culture, politics, and media, From the Desk of Alicia Kennedy, has over 25,000 subscribers. Her work has recently appeared in many publications including Foreign Policy, Bon Appétit, SSENSE, and Harper’s Bazaar.

His career spans 20 years of cooking in some of the best restaurants across the country, honing his skills under chefs like Gordon Ramsay, Guy Savoy, and Laurent Gras. Rubba has branched out on his own, focusing his life’s work to sustainability. Chef Rubba, being a vegetarian himself, prepares a seasonal, local, plant-forward tasting menu that expresses the beautiful bounty of the Mid-Atlantic, all while staying true to the ethos of zero waste, low carbon footprint, and supporting regenerative farming practices.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/bold-fork-books-36931109723,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/an-evening-with-alicia-kennedy-and-rob-rubba-for-no-meat-required-tickets-692458009547,DC

About A DARKER WILDERNESS:A vibrant collection of personal and lyric essays in conversation with archival objects of Black history and memory.What are the politics of nature? Who owns it, where is it, what role does it play in our lives? Does it need to be tamed? Are we ourselves natural? In A Darker Wilderness, a constellation of luminary writers reflect on the significance of nature in their lived experience and on the role of nature in the lives of Black folks in the United States. Each of these essays engages with a single archival object, whether directly or obliquely, exploring stories spanning hundreds of years and thousands of miles, traveling from roots to space and finding rich Blackness everywhere.Erin Sharkey considers Benjamin Banneker’s 1795 almanac, as she follows the passing of seasons in an urban garden in Buffalo. Naima Penniman reflects on a statue of Haitian revolutionary François Makandal, within her own pursuit of environmental justice. Ama Codjoe meditates on rain, hair, protest, and freedom via a photo of a young woman during a civil rights demonstration in Alabama. And so on—with wide-ranging contributions from Carolyn Finney, Ronald Greer II, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Sean Hill, Michael Kleber-Diggs, Glynn Pogue, Katie Robinson, and Lauret Savoy—unearthing evidence of the ways Black people’s relationship to the natural world has persevered through colonialism, slavery, state-sponsored violence, and structurally racist policies like Jim Crow and redlining.A scrapbook, a family chest, a quilt—and an astounding work of historical engagement and literary accomplishment—A Darker Wilderness is a collection brimming with abundance and insight.A Darker Wilderness is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!

A Vagrant, there was Katie Beaton of the Cape Breton Beaton, specifically Mabou, a tight-knit seaside community where the lobster is as abundant as beaches, fiddles, and Gaelic folk songs. With the singular goal of paying off her student loans, Katie heads out west to take advantage of Alberta’s oil rush—part of the long tradition of East Coasters who seek gainful employment elsewhere when they can’t find it in the homeland they love so much. Katie encounters the harsh reality of life in the oil sands, where trauma is an everyday occurrence yet is never discussed.Beaton’s natural cartooning prowess is on full display as she draws colossal machinery and mammoth vehicles set against a sublime Albertan backdrop of wildlife, northern lights, and boreal forest. Her first full length graphic narrative, Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is an untold story of Canada: a country that prides itself on its egalitarian ethos and natural beauty while simultaneously exploiting both the riches of its land and the humanity of its people.Ducks is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!

Originally built as a private residence, the 38,000 square-foot English-style Tudor Castle sits on 55 rolling acres and is conveniently located just west of Richmond, Virginia. Prior to breaking ground in 1996, the original owners hired two local partners, Spangler and Associates, and Yoggy & Crow to handle the architecture and interior design. Spangler suggested English Country due to the grand scale and uniqueness of the owner’s vision. For two years, Yoggy & Crow traveled throughout Europe and sourced the vast majority of all décor, paintings, fireplace mantels, and furnishings from estates and auctions. The house was designed to resemble an English-style Tudor castle with heavy Gothic and Elizabethan influences.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/dover-hall-15239741635,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/craft-beverage-showcase-supporting-the-richmond-west-trail-tickets-676023653947,DC

You will also have an opportunity to help with the composting processes. Attending the one-hour orientation is required to gain access to the bin. You will receive a member agreement and then gain the ability start dropping-off your food scraps.About UsWhen Lancaster Compost Co-Ops was started in April 2021, Lancaster residents had zero alternatives to divert organic food and garden scraps from the general waste stream beyond individual backyards. Composting is a mainstream activity in American cities – and we believed it was high time for Lancaster to address the existing community interest.LCC currently has five co-op sites in Lancaster City. Each site has a critter proof and smell proof compost bin in a public space that allows trained community members to create high quality compost. A local community member, or ""captain,"" independently runs the site with the support of the community participants.To learn more, check out our website (www.lancastercompost.us) or Instagram (LancasterCompost).

Quite different from what I expected (thought we would be sharing ideas on how to make a difference etc), rather we focused on deep connection and listening to our own and everyone’s feelings. I left the event at peace and inspired to continue on the journey. Grateful to Liz and Cynthia for beautifully holding the space and to everyone who attended - thank you and look forward to the next one” - Barbara“This was my first time at a climate cafe and at first I questioned the value of just talking about my feelings around the climate crisis, I wanted to talk about what we were going to do about it! But I soon realised that deep self-enquiry into how the crisis affects me on an emotional level was absolutely what I needed, and precisely what's missing from so much of the public conversation around climate change.

Exploratory Debate: How to stop the Climate Crisis?,"September 15, 2023, 03:00 PM","September 15, 2023, 05:00 PM","8 John Adam Street, London, WC2N 6EZ, United Kingdom","Heat waves, draughts, forest fires, scarcity of water, and on the other hand  devastating tropical storms and regular floods, inundating large areas of land and destroying homes as increasingly worrying indications of the huge destruction the Climate Crisis is likely to inflict on the planet and on humanity. Supporting these forebodings are express warnings by scientists that the Climate Crisis is likely to widely annihilate the conditions for human life on earth and that it constitutes a threat to entire civilisation. Yet, despite the apparent overwhelming urgency of the Climate Crisis, humanity so far does not manage to stop it. The goal to limit the increase in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius appears in danger.
What are the reasons? Can we still stop the Climate Crisis at all? What can and must our precise goals realistically be? And what are the factors necessary to perhaps still succeed in the fight against the Climate Crisis and to avert its threats for humanity? 
The debate will aim to answer these questions based on a structured systemic analysis of the factors relevant for the success in the fight against the Climate Crisis. Participants are expected to contribute their views. Depending on how the discussion goes, its outcome might be an action plan to initiate an effective way to ensure we at least achieve the 1.5 degree goal, even if this might appear a near to impossible task.

"Climate change, coastal hazards and resilience","September 13, 2023, 06:30 PM","September 13, 2023, 09:30 PM","2 Audley Square, London, W1K 1DB, United Kingdom","Professor Roger Moore is the global technology leader of geoscience at Sussex university and a consultant Jacobs. He is a UK Registered Ground Engineering Adviser, Chartered Geologist, and Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers and Geological Society of London. He was appointed Professor of Applied Geomorphology at the University of Sussex in 2010, convening MSc teaching and supervising PhD research. With 34 years’ commercial experience, he is a global subject matter expert in geohazards specialising in extreme weather-induced ground instability resilience of development and infrastructure. He has a diverse project portfolio including national policy advice, strategic planning and development, environmental and nuclear safety cases, site characterisation, climate impact assessment, transportation resilience, geohazard management, and design and build of civil protection and land stabilisation schemes. He is an advocate of advanced technology, research and innovation for geoscience specifically: remote sensing terrain and subsea engineering geomorphology, geophysics, site investigation & monitoring data integration, 3D/4D engineering ground behaviour models. Roger has co-authored eight industry practice publications and over 60 peer-reviewed articles. His latest guidance book was published in August 2021 on the subject of ‘Coastal Erosion and Climate Change: Guidance for Policymakers, Planners and Stakeholders’.Background 
Climate change is one of the most significant issues affecting modern society. In the UK, projections of future climate indicate hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters combined with an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, storms and heat waves; furthermore, sea level rise of up to 1m is predicted by the year 2100 for low to medium emissions scenarios, and up to 2.5m for extreme scenarios (e.g. UKCP18; Edwards 2017). These predictions will have serious consequences for cities, communities and infrastructure located at the coast due to the impacts of coastal flooding, erosion and cliff instability. 
The adverse consequences of coastal hazards and climate change are a global issue.  They pose significant challenges for jurisdictions and decision-makers involved in both planning and risk management, and for affected communities and businesses.  Escalating costs and financial constraints mean it will not be possible to fund mitigation measures for the increasing number of communities and infrastructure affected by natural hazard events.  This will necessitate innovative approaches for the avoidance of risks through the implementation of adaptation strategies, future-proofing civil designs and sharing good practice advice and guidance for governments, policymakers, utilities, developers and local communities. 
An appreciation of the physical and geological conditions affecting a state or territory can contribute to sustainable development by helping policymakers and planning officers understand the constraints imposed on developments by the physical environment; for example, as a result of the impacts of erosion, cliff instability, flooding and human activity in coastal zones.  Background research has highlighted the vital importance of effective links between engineers and planning officers at regional and local levels in order to reduce the risks to people, development and infrastructure from natural hazards, such as coastal flooding, erosion and landslides. 
Many organisations involved in coastal management across the world have long-standing experiences of addressing the risks arising from coastal erosion, landsliding and inundation by the sea.  However, the predicted impacts of climate change at the coast, that have long been anticipated, are now with us and are becoming increasingly severe.  In fact, many regard climate change as potentially one of the most serious threats to humanity, with far reaching and devastating impacts on coastal communities, infrastructure, natural environments and economies.  “Climate impacts affect all regions of the world and cut across all sectors of society.  People who do the least to cause the problem, especially those living in poverty and fragile areas, are sometimes most at risk” (Global Commission on Adaptation, 2019).  In Europe alone, the economic value of coastal areas within 500 m of the sea amounts to up to €1,000 billion. The costs of doing nothing to mitigate the effects of climate change in coastal zones are estimated to be significantly higher than the annual costs of taking actions, whilst the net benefits of adapting to these changing conditions can often represent a far more beneficial approach in terms of sustainable coastal economies and environments. 
In England, the predicted impacts of climate change at the coast are concerning and include rising sea level of over 1m by the end of the century and, potentially, up to 2.5m. The frequency of intense storm events is also increasing and alongside rising sea level the result will be far more extensive coastal erosion, flooding and resulting impacts.  In the UK, over half a million properties, including 370,000 homes, located in areas of significant risk from coastal flooding, whilst nearly 9,000 properties may be at risk from coastal erosion; this figure could double by the end of the century. Apart from properties, critical infrastructure including nuclear, oil and gas terminals, ports and harbours, roads, railways, landfill sites and cultural heritage assets are likely to be lost unless appropriate actions can be taken. Along soft and unstable cliffs, a further 100,000 properties could become increasingly at risk from erosion and landslides (Committee on Climate Change, 2018).  
Across Europe, the European Commission took the lead in promoting integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) in the 1990s, and this approach has since become well established in many countries (European Commission, 1999; 2002).  The concept of shoreline management planning, aimed at providing a long-term, forward-looking strategy for managing coastal risks, has been developed and widely implemented in the United Kingdom; since then extensive technical and non-technical guidance has been published in support of these approaches (Burgess et al., 2004; Defra, 2009; McInnes & Moore, 2011; 2014).  However, many of these coastal policy initiatives are non-statutory and provide guidance in contrast to planning systems, which are usually statutory.  Globally, the rate and scale of change that is now being experienced, and which is widely expected to increase significantly in the next decades, demands closer integration between the coastal management and planning disciplines, both at the national policy level and, particularly, at the local government level.  
Whilst the protection of cities, towns and key coastal infrastructure is likely to be maintained or enhanced in the face of climate change, it is becoming increasingly obvious that some coastal management policies, which have sought to manage risks through traditional approaches such as civil engineering measures, may prove to be unsustainable in the future.  New strategies are, therefore, required which focus on adaptive management, which require coordination between the coastal engineering and planning disciplines at the local level.  The setting of new policies and approaches to coastal risk management through close working with stakeholders is fundamental for sharing transferable opportunities, experience and lessons learnt.
The nature of problems relating to planning policy in local and regional government has been voiced to the author at meetings with UK Coastal Groups and government planning officers.  They report reductions in public expenditure combined with changes to planning policy guidance have weakened significantly both the technical and the planning input to sustainable policymaking and, hence, coastal hazard risk reduction in the face of climate change.  Discussions with stakeholders at international conferences involved in coastal risk management and planning in France, Italy, the Netherlands and the USA suggest that this is a wide-ranging, worsening problem that is not exclusive to the United Kingdom.
Discussion points
1.	The impacts of climate change necessitate even closer integration between coastal risk management, planning policy and development control particularly at the regional and local levels. What initiatives are GSL involved or could promote to address the challenges faced by government authorities, communities, industry and stakeholders, UK and worldwide?
2.	There is need to promote research and to gather data of all kinds to better understand the potential for erosion, landsliding and flooding. This information will help to prevent disasters through the identification of trends and the development of appropriate early-warning systems, which should be embedded in risk governance. The fundamental control of geology and geohazard processes in response to climate change (e.g. energy transition) is often poorly understood, should this be a focus area for GSL research? 
3.	A failing of past planning policy and development decisions to account for climate change is short-term thinking which inadvertently creates a legacy of issues and risks for future generations to manage. Thorough understanding of long-term change is an essential requirement to support planning and mitigate future impacts. GSL has a role to play to ensure full advantage is taken of valuable historical data alongside a range of new technologies and geological timeframes to better understand the potential for change over extended time periods.
4.	A range of approaches to the management of coastal change have been developed, packaged as adaptation measures. These include improved coastal defence measures, coastal realignment, natural defences and habitat creation, compulsory purchase and compensation, land banking and the relocation of small communities. The solutions described offer wide transferability value. Does GSL have a view on the appropriateness of these approaches at national and regional level e.g. comparison of UK and France policies to compensate local communities?
5.	Due to the global economic downturn over the last decade, local government has seen significant reductions in funding and loss of specialist staff in the coastal engineering and planning disciplines. What professional support can GSL provide government authorities, industry, and communities in need of specialists to provide advice on Coastal Hazards, Climate Change and Geo-Resilience?

Our aim is to give local transport, climate and countryside and nature campaigners an opportunity to share ideas and inspiration. We want to celebrate our successes and work out what we need to focus on over the next 12 months or so before a General Election and in the face of some extraordinary backlashes to taking action on health and climate grounds.A﻿lso, this year marks some notable anniversaries, it being the 30th anniversary of the first ever national anti-roads conference and major protests at Twyford Down, while it is the 60th anniversary of the infamous Beeching report. To mark the occasion Emma Must, a prominent campaigner from the 1990s and ALARM UK days has agreed to read some of her poetry about the anti-roads movement.W﻿e've got some great speakers and contributors:Jonathan Bray - ex-director, Urban Transport GroupRoxanne de Beaux - Executive Director, Camcycle (part of Cambridge Sustainable Travel Alliance)Isabelle Clement MBE - CEO, Wheels for WellbeingC﻿laire Haigh - founder & CEO of Greener VisionRoger Harrabin - former BBC environment correspondentLisa Hopkinson - associate of Transport for Quality of LifeProfessor Glenn Lyons - Professor of Future Mobility, UWE BristolDavid Milner - Deputy Director, Create StreetsStefan Rollnick - Head of The Misinformation Cell, Lynn GlobalWe've gone for London to make it easier for those from the East and South East who  found it difficult getting to Birmingham last year. The venue is close to Kings Cross and Euston so is still easy to get to from the North and the Midlands. We aim to put the spotlight on the existential threat to public transport and active travel as the Government cuts funding in order to allow it to build more roads. This is while the potholes on local roads get ever bigger. At the same time The Government has ordered Network Rail not to replace worn out infrastructure, creating a short term saving but costing more in the long term. The Government's obsession with making things worse is seen by its determined inaction on cutting carbon quickly enough as it now admits it won't meet its international target to cut emissions by 68% by 2030.W﻿e also want to run some sessions to give campaigners the understanding and skills to deal with some of the disingenuous and toxic messaging that is being used against cutting traffic.T﻿AN 2022 conference in BirminghamWe will have two sets of workshops, covering a variety of topics as follows, so there should be something for everyone: Lessons from Welsh Roads Review &  road policy changes in EnglandWhere to next for buses?The future of railActive travel - achieving the 2030 targetAir pollution: What next for Clean Air Zones and more?Nature / biodiversity / roadkillHow can we get planning to step off the road to nowhere?Campaign messaging - mythbusting and reclaiming the narrativeMedia training - how to write a press release, appear on radio / TV The event will provide the perfect opportunity for networking and meeting people you mostly only ever see on a screen. We hope it will cement friendships and empower the large number of people who have been campaigning at a grassroots level over the past few years.If you would like to reclaim your entrance ticket and rail fare we do have a small amount to pay for bursaries.

TRUTHS will make a ten-fold improvement in how we can observe and quantify climate change through its own direct measurements of the sun’s energy and how that is scattered, reflected and absorbed by the Earth. TRUTHS will also provide a ‘gold standard’ reference data set that can be used to calibrate other satellites. In this lecture, we will show how TRUTHS will provide such an upgrade in performance of the global satellite Earth observation system, and how that upgrade, along with related work on a broad range of satellite missions, will improve the quality of climate change modelling and forecasting, enable the more rapid identification of changes in the Earth’s system and provide an essential climate information dashboard to support climate mitigation and adaptation action.

Net Zero Nations Projects Conference,"November 15, 2023, 08:30 AM","November 15, 2023, 04:00 PM","1 Great George Street Westminster, London, SW1P 3AA, United Kingdom","We are at a crossroads in our historyAs we recover from the impact of the pandemic on our lives and livelihoods, we know that it will not be enough to go back to the way things were before.The science is clear, we know that human activity is changing our climate and that this will have a devastating impact on human lives, the economy, and the natural world – ranging from the extinction of some species and the melting of ice caps to extreme weather patterns threatening our homes, businesses, and communities. Energy security and net zero are two sides of the same coin. The energy transition and net zero are among the greatest opportunities facing this country and we are committed to ensuring that the UK takes advantage of its early mover status. Global action to mitigate climate change is essential to long term prosperity – the overall costs and risks of global warming to be equivalent to losing between 5% and 20% of global GDP each year.After decades of reliance on imported fossil fuels, the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s mission is to replace them with cheaper, cleaner, domestic sources of energy. In response to high household energy bills resulting from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the government stepped in, paying around half of the average household’s energy bills over winter and around half of wholesale energy costs for some businesses. But the way to maintain lower cost energy for everyone is to move to cleaner and cheaper energy to protect us from volatile international energy markets, while underpinning our clean energy transition, so the UK becomes a net zero economy by 2050. It will also help us make sure Britain has among the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe by 2035. The UK has already made huge progress in decarbonising its economy and decoupling emissions from economic growth. Thanks to the Climate Change Act (2008) and Environment Act (2021), we have a strong legal framework for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Between 1990 and 2021, we have cut our emissions by 48%, decarbonising faster than any other G7 country, whilst growing the economy by 65%. The UK was also the first G7 country to sign net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 into law. The UK’s strategy for net-zero is to lead the world in ending our contribution to climate change while turning this mission into the greatest opportunity for jobs and prosperity for our country since the industrial revolution.Removing dirty fossil fuels from the global economy will lead to the creation of vast new global industries from offshore wind to electric vehicles and carbon capture and storage. By moving first and making the United Kingdom the birthplace of the Green Industrial Revolution we are building a defining competitive edge. The changes will have wider benefits for the public and businesses alike. We will all enjoy cleaner air, increased biodiversity and improved access to green spaces. We will see greater efficiency in the way we travel and heat our buildings, which will be better protected from more extreme weather events. We will also put consumers at the heart of this transition, helping them make their homes warmer, and more efficient, and ensure that they pay a fair, affordable price for their energy.In 2050, we will still be driving cars, flying planes and heating our homes, but our cars will be electric gliding silently around our cities, our planes will be zero-emission allowing us to fly guilt-free, and our homes will be heated by cheap reliable power drawn from the winds of the North Sea. And everywhere you look, in every part of our United Kingdom, there will be jobs. Good jobs, green jobs, well-paid jobs, levelling up our country while squashing down our carbon emissions. That is the clean and prosperous future that awaits every one of us as the UK leads the world in the race to net zero. But we cannot tackle climate change alone. We will need to take a coordinated approach, working across local and national government, the devolved administrations, and with businesses and civil society organisations. And we will need to make it easier and fairer for individuals, businesses and households to decarbonise so that our whole society can work together to reduce emissions. Don’t miss this fantastic opportunity to attend the conference and hear from those leading on the net-zero agenda by highlighting key examples of case studies and projects from around the world using new innovations and technologies which can help accelerate the transition to a net-zero nation by 2050.Join us on the 15th of Novembner 2023 for the Net Zero Nations Projects Conference.Get Involved, We All Have A Part to Play…..Find Yours!",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/evolutional-events-44657800583,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/net-zero-nations-projects-conference-registration-670628737607,London
Workshop: A vision for climate reparations: What's debt got to do with it?,"August 26, 2023, 02:00 PM","August 26, 2023, 05:00 PM","14 Baylis Road, London, SE1 7AA, United Kingdom","Are you a member of a grassroots group working on issues of climate, racial, or economic justice, or another social justice issue?Want to learn how debt and colonialism relate to your organising, and how we can use messaging around the two to make our movements stronger? Want to dive deeper into building a vision for transformative climate reparations? Want to see that collective vision turned into a piece of artwork for an upcoming exhibition on the topic? Join us for a workshop in London on Saturday 26th August. This interactive workshop will reflect on  the history of the colonial debt crisis, what it means for our wider movements, and how we can work together to support each other’s campaigns. We will explore the concept of climate reparations and how debt justice can be part of a broader agenda to repair the harm faced by communities around the world. As part of the workshop, we’ll be co-creating an artistic response to the topic to be displayed at an exhibition on debt, colonialism, and the climate crisis at Peckham Levels in November 2023. If you don’t consider yourself an artist, don’t worry - we still want you to come along and input into our shared vision for change. Right now, 54 countries are in debt crisis, with the need to make repayments stopping them from investing in healthcare, education, and responding to the climate crisis. This is not an accident. For centuries, powerful governments, institutions and corporations have used debt to control and plunder the resources of countries in the global south for their own gain. At the same time, countries and communities in the global south are disproportionately facing the impacts of the climate crisis.From colonial powers forcing countries into debt at the point of independence, to allowing corporations like BlackRock to continue to make huge profits from debt repayments today, we can’t build new visions of reparative justice without understanding the roots of the crisis we face.When: Saturday 26th August 2023, 2pm-5pm.Where: Dance Hall, Waterloo Action Centre, SE1 7AAAccess information: Wheelchair access, accessible toilets.

Climate cafés are not drop-in events, and numbers are limited to 12, so please try to arrive in time for the start (though we won’t turn you away if you’re a few minutes late and there are still spaces!).Climate Cafés offer something different from the usual gatherings of people with interests in climate change. They are facilitated – so you can be sure that there will be space for you to speak. They are not designed to recruit you to do anything or to put you under any pressure. The idea behind them is that talking about climate change is really important – but it is often made more difficult by our feelings of guilt that we are not doing enough, or frustration that others are not doing enough. So a space is provided in which we don’t talk about what we or others are doing or should be doing. We just talk about climate change and how it is making us think and feel.Everyone is welcome, though we don’t advise young children attending. (18 years plus) There’s no charge.

Devil’s Botany London Absinthe is an exquisite aperitif reminiscent of a British meadow. Distilled with a bouquet of the finest botanicals, Absinthe’s historic trinity of grand wormwood, green anise and fennel seed is expertly blended with local botanicals such as elderflower, lemon balm and meadowsweet that can be found growing wild across London.During this workshop, guests will be able to choose from a large variety of pressed flowers to be arranged on quality A4 paper during. All the necessary equipment will be provided.  Everyone walks out with their creation in a pretty envelope afterwards.Event suitable for 18+ years and older only. Maddy’s Workshop is a local East London based decor brand created by french artisan Manon Le Fer. All flowers are sourced sustainably from temperate climates. The pressing process allows us to keep and sell them all year round until the next bloom. Just like humans, every flower is unique. Thus, Maddy's Workshop tries to reveal the beauty in each of them.https://maddysworkshop.com/+Devil’s Botany is London’s first Absinthe distillery, celebrating the forgotten elixirs of London's curious past. Launched in January 2021, their original recipes call upon the traditions once mastered by the apothecaries of 18th Century London, the vast herbarium of flavours they housed and the botanical elixirs concocted. Hidden within their recipe books was a key to the origins of absinthe that had previously remained unknown. Nearly a century before the first commercial distilleries opened elsewhere in the world, London’s dram-drinkers were already enjoying a precursor to the botanical spirit made by the local apothecaries. Delightfully bittersweet and clear in colour, the noble aperitif has been praised for its revitalising flavour and found most effective in raising the spirits for over 300 years.https://www.devilsbotany.com/",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/the-last-tuesday-society-viktor-wynd-museum-33776720489,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/pressed-flower-workshop-wildflower-spritz-with-devils-botany-tickets-649628184387,London

The Climate Cafe - Worthing,"September 27, 2023, 07:00 PM","September 27, 2023, 09:00 PM","South Street, Worthing, BN11 3AL, United Kingdom","As it becomes more evident that climate and ecological breakdown are a clear and present danger to our safety and wellbeing, we increasingly need to talk about what our changing world means for us in terms of impacts at personal, family and societal level. We need to imagine it in some detail so as to be able to think about it clearly and constructively, and to explore some complex feelings and thoughts which may often be taboo and hard to talk about.With sturdy enough support structures in place, most people can sustain challenging feelings without either dissociating and numbing or going into blind panic. They can engage with difficult truths whilst staying connected and grounded.A climate café aims to be such a structure - a container that is strong enough to allow the exploration of fear, anxiety, and other emotions such as anger, helplessness, sadness, grief or depression.The focus of discussion is participants’ thoughts and feelings about the climate and ecological crisis. There are no guest speakers and no talks, and it is an advice-free zone. CREW are a voluntary non-profit charity and we are passionate about ensuring our climate centre continues to stay open for all of us who are striving for a better and more sustainable future.

Thinking About Disability and Climate Change,"September 20, 2023, 01:30 PM","September 20, 2023, 03:00 PM","12 East 41st Street Room 701, New York, NY 10017","Disability must be addressed as an important part of climate policy because it is present in every race, sex, class, sexual preference, age, and everything else.  Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don’t understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ·	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ·	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ·	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ·	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,·	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right. Together, we can create a just, sustainable future for everyone.

As global leaders gather in New York for the UN Climate Ambition Summit and General Assembly, we are calling on governments to reckon with their role in fueling climate chaos, and harm against frontline communities and the planet  by continuing the extraction of fossil fuels . We only have a limited amount of years left to address and mitigate the worst impacts of the  climate crisis.For years, global climate movements have been calling for governments to phase out fossil fuels and stop expansion. We continue to pressure governments, corporations, and financial institutions to adhere to the demands of  science and communities, and implement an immediate equitable phaseout of fossil fuels. Instead, governments must invest in and deploy a Just Transition that is grounded in a climate justice framework and uplifts care economies, community-led solutions, Indigenous rights,  and a different vision than business as usual.During this event, we will host two panels, please see below for descriptions.“Women Ending the Era of Fossil Fuels”During this panel discussion, global women leaders will share expertise and frameworks for transitioning away from extraction and share ongoing policy advocacy and campaigns that seek to phase out fossil fuels, deforestation, and other harmful extractive practices. “Women-led Climate Solutions Are Central to a Just Transition and Thriving  Future”In the second panel we will hear from  global women leaders and policy experts on how to implement and support  solutions that are advancing  a Just Transition. Speakers will share demonstrated successes of women’s leadership in implementing just community-led climate solutions. ------------------------------------------------------------Registration informationRegistration is required.

Steven is a leading thinker operating at the intersection of climate, law, and corporate power, and is the first US attorney to be jailed by a corporation in retaliation for his human rights work.After helping Amazon communities win a historic $9.5 billion pollution judgment against Chevron, the company retaliated and prosecuted him for contempt of court in New York after he refused to turn his computer and confidential case file over to his adversary counsel. The federal prosecutor rejected the charges, which were filed by a pro-corporate judge with financial ties to the company.The judge appointed a Chevron law firm to prosecute Steven in the name of the US government.The private Chevron prosecutor immediately ordered Steven locked up at home with a 24/7 monitoring device on his ankle, while his trial was delayed for over two years. He ended up spending 993 days in detention and in prison for a misdemeanor offense with a maximum sentence of 180 days; the judge denied him a jury.He is still the only person ever in the US locked up in retaliation for his human rights work. Chevron used 60 law firms and 2,000 lawyers to attack Steven.

They will discuss feminist foreign policy and the accelerating climate crisis with each other and the audience.

Kristina Lunz will give insights into her latest book “The Future of Foreign Policy is Feminist”, which will be published in English later this year. While the book is not yet available in the United States, three copies will be raffled to the audience during the event.Kristina Lunz and her ""Centre for Feminist Foreign Policy"" are trying to change that. The political scientist, activist and entrepreneur thinks peace, human rights and justice together with foreign policy and wants to initiate a paradigm shift: She counters power play and military muscle games with mediation in peace negotiations, feminist power analyses and climate justice. Realpolitik is exchanged for utopias, and there are just as many women ambassadors as ambassadors. In this way, the antagonism of nations can finally be replaced, and everyone will be able to live in greater security and with fewer conflicts.Enuma Okoro is a Nigerian-American author, journalist, lecturer, and cultural curator. She is a weekly columnist for the Financial Times weekend newspaper. Her column, “The Art of Life,” reflects on the intersection of art, philosophy, spirituality, culture and how we live. Her broader research and writing interests include considering how the arts, intersectional feminism, philosophy, language and knowledge theory, theology and contemplative eco-spirituality speak into the study of the human condition, how we relate to the more-than-human, and how we accumulate and produce knowledge. 

She is convinced that stories, through their varying mediums, are how we challenge old narratives, free our imaginations, and tell new and expanded truths that shift perceptions and instigate change.VENUE ACCESSIBILITY

As social and ecological crises escalate globally, it is clear that the dominant cultural worldview, informed by colonization, patriarchy, capitalism, and racism is displaying a relationship with Nature and each other that is devastatingly unjust and out of balance. To live in a healthy and equitable world, we must fundamentally change how we respect and interact with the Earth and one another. To change the present and future, it is imperative to change the narrative and amplify worldviews and stories of climate justice solutions that transform the dominant worldview from an extractivist, colonial paradigm of “exploit and extract” to a sustainable, globally-conscious one of “respect and restore.”At this event, movement leaders and change-makers will weave together stories, worldviews, and experiences of restoration and justice that demonstrate the healthy and equitable world we know is possible and needed. We knew in our bones this time was coming, and now we must act in solidarity more than ever, continuing to build a powerful movement founded on principles of justice, love, and a fierce dedication to our planet and our communities.This event is also the pre-launch of the forthcoming book by Osprey Orielle Lake, ""The Story is in Our Bones: How Worldviews and Climate Justice Can Remake a World in Crisis,"" to be released in January 2024.  Abundant hors d’oeuvres and drinks will be served.

Through active stewardship—including thinning and harvest work—King County is improving forest health and long-term resilience in the face of a changing climate.During this four-hour tour you'll see a demonstration of climate adaptation techniques at work, along with other approaches King County is using to transition this former industrial plantation to ecological forest management, focusing on managing hardwood forests and establishing conifers. The tour includes several stands that recently had pre-commercial thinning, mixed conifer-hardwood stands that were thinned several years ago, and hardwood stands that are planned for a commercial harvest. We'll discuss how King County's harvests are setting up the forest for long-term climate resilience, mitigating drought and heat-induced moisture stress by spreading available soil moisture among fewer trees, enhancing their odds of survival. These same climate adaptation techniques can be applied to private non-industrial forestlands elsewhere.Topics to be discussed will include: The climate adaptation rationale behind pre-commercial (small-diameter) thinningHarvest prescription and tree selection criteriaClimate adaptation strategies (tree selection, residual density)Options for utilizing cut material and harvest slashLogging costs & economics in hardwood-dominated forestsWorking with a contractorQuestions?

The Balance of Energy between all thingsLocated on a historic farm estate, Orenda winery blends rustic-charm with classic-elegance. Orenda is the perfect location for your event.Orenda Winery brought together three friends with a shared commitment—to build community and to bring Orenda to winemaking. We believe wine should maintain a balance between bold and subtle flavors. To execute this vision, we have partnered with some of the highest elevation vineyards in Washington state in both Yakima Valley and Columbia Valley. High elevation provides a cool climate with late ripening fruit. This allows the grapes more time to mature, making wine less bold and significantly more subtle than wines from warmer regions. When aged in small French oak barrels, the results are complex, dynamic flavors reminiscent of an old-world style rarely found in Washington wines.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/della-terra-14728494784,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/farm-to-table-winemakers-dinner-featuring-della-terra-orenda-winery-tickets-633333907767,Seattle

In our culture, however, we have forgotten how to share our grief with one another.  In addition to our personal losses, given the emergent climate crisis and its impacts – the extinction of species, the COVID pandemic, and the unrest and turmoil within human societies – the burden of grief that we are carrying as individuals can begin to feel unbearable. There are very few spaces where we are invited to experience and express this complex grief in community. This retreat will utilize Francis Weller’s “Five Gates of Grief” to connect participants to their distinct and multifaceted experiences of grief in the context of a ""sudden village."". The weekend will be facilitated by experienced grief mentors who have apprenticed in the grief ritual tradition of the Dagara tribe as brought to the U.S. and shared by Malidoma and Sobonfu Somé. We have been oriented to this tradition through mentorship with Francis Weller and others. Participants will be guided through chanting, poetry, teaching, writing exercises, small group sharing, and the creation of a grief shrine. Our time together will culminate in a communal grief ritual. All participation is invitational; nothing is ""required"" beyond being present with and sharing the griefs you are carrying, to the best of your ability.Fee: $400 - Early Bird Registration by August  15; $450 after August 15. If the fee presents a barrier to your participation, please let us know.R﻿ecent significant loss: If you have experienced a significant or traumatic loss within the last three months, please reach out to speak with a facilitator before registering.Registration Deadline: Thursday, September 28.

"Tele Aadsen in conversation with Holly Hughes, What Water Holds","October 01, 2023, 04:00 PM","October 01, 2023, 05:00 PM","1200 11th Street, Bellingham, WA 98225","This is another event in the Nature of Writing series, in partnership with our friends at the North Cascades Institute.About the bookIn What Water Holds, female commercial fisherman Tele Aadsen shares a series of lyrical, reflective essays first read at Oregon's FisherPoets Gathering. Tele examines questions of equity, identity, community, the changing climate, and sustainability, revealing complexities with loving, detailed attention. Weaving stories of what lies beneath the surface and—if we choose—the possibilities beyond, What Water Holds speaks to anyone seeking to live a full, deeply considered life.Tele Aadsen entered commercial salmon fishing at seven years old on her parents' homemade trolling boat, and what better guide could there be to a living, and a life, made at sea? Her clear-eyed essays overflow with warmth and precision, honoring work, gender, community and creatures in complicated ways. Shearwaters and boat cats, potlucks and rescues, depression and recovery: Aadsen casts a wide net, and the reader can trust her eye, ear, mind and heart. A fine contribution to the working woman's canon. ~Christine Byl, author of Lookout and Dirt Work: An Education in the WoodsIn this slim, elegant volume, Tele Aadsen evokes the sea and the fishing community in all its peril and poetry. From childhood on, hers is a life lived from dock to deck, and the empathy and understanding she brings to her past resonates on every page. Her hard-earned wisdom is rendered in brilliant writing. The reader can savor these essays one at a time, or plunge through the whole book and be equally delighted. Read What Water Holds and you will never look at salmon in quite the same way again. ~Laura Kalpakian, author of Memory into MemoirAbout the authors Tele Aadsen is a writer, commercial fisherman, and lapsed social worker.

"Chuckanut Radio Hour Featuring David B. Williams, Homewaters","September 14, 2023, 07:00 PM","September 14, 2023, 08:00 PM","1314 Harris Avenue, Bellingham, WA 98225","Take a deep dive with us into the vibrant history of the Puget Sound with David B. Williams, a naturalist, author, and educator, to discuss his book Homewaters. His many books include the award-winning Too High and Too Steep: Reshaping Seattle's Topography and Seattle Walks: Discovering History and Nature in the City.  David B. Williams will be interviewed by bestselling author Erica Bauermeister, directly after they return to land from the Schooner Zodiac Books a'Sail Cruise, 2023! Click here for more information on a book group at sea!Doors open and music begins at 6:30pm!Musical Guest: Ben BauermeisterSpaces are limited and REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED to secure your spot so don't delay. About the bookNot far from Seattle skyscrapers live 150-year-old clams, more than 250 species of fish, and underwater kelp forests as complex as any terrestrial ecosystem. For millennia, vibrant Coast Salish communities have lived beside these waters dense with nutrient-rich foods, with cultures intertwined through exchanges across the waterways. Transformed by settlement and resource extraction, Puget Sound and its future health now depend on a better understanding of the region's ecological complexities.Focusing on the area south of Port Townsend and between the Cascade and Olympic mountains, Williams uncovers human and natural histories in, on, and around the Sound. In conversations with archaeologists, biologists, and tribal authorities, Williams traces how generations of humans have interacted with such species as geoducks, salmon, orcas, rockfish, and herring. He sheds light on how warfare shaped development and how people have moved across this maritime highway, in canoes, the mosquito fleet, and today's ferry system. The book also takes an unflinching look at how the Sound's ecosystems have suffered from human behavior, including pollution, habitat destruction, and the effects of climate change.Witty, graceful, and deeply informed, Homewaters weaves history and science into a fascinating and hopeful narrative, one that will introduce newcomers to the astonishing life that inhabits the Sound and offers longtime residents new insight into and appreciation of the waters they call home.""Homewaters is a sweeping exploration of how a place shapes lives. It begins with glaciers and volcanoes carving up Puget Sound, and examines early Native communities’ relationships with their environment, colonial exploitation of natural resources and efforts to better understand how keystone and emblematic species like salmon, orca, rockfish, herring, kelp and more are enduring the conditions of the Sound today."" -- CrosscutAbout the presentersDavid B. Williams is a writer, historian, and tour guide focused on the intersection between people and landscape, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.Erica Bauermeister is the author of the bestselling novel The School of Essential Ingredients, Joy for Beginners, and The Lost Art of Mixing.

Generating over half of the state’s greenhouse gases, the transportation sector is a major part of state and local decarbonization goals. At the same time, the state’s transportation infrastructure is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially increased storm activity and sea level rise. This session shares how the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and BART have recently explored bold changes to their transportation infrastructure and regulation to confront both challenges. SFMTA’s Climate Roadmap tackles the city’s ambitious emission and mode share goals through a suite of transformative interventions that draw on international case studies. In addition, their Waterfront Resiliency Transportation Assessment addresses the substantial impact that sea level rise and potential defense strategies will have on the city’s eastern waterfront and ways to adapt the transportation network to such a reality. BART's Sustainability Action Plan outlines BART's strategy to reduce emissions, optimize energy use, and incorporate climate resilience into districtwide operations. BART also has a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to reduce or eliminate risks to the system from natural disasters, particularly those that would be exacerbated by climate change.The panel will include representatives from the projects discussing the innovative analytical approaches and implementation frameworks leveraged, with lessons that other jurisdictions can utilize for their own climate mitigation and adaptation. The session will include a moderated discussion and Q&A to engage with the audience.Program ParticipantsModerators: 	Taylor McAdam, Senior Transportation Planner, Fehr & Peers Panelists: 	 Tim Doherty, Policy and Long-Range Planning Team Lead - San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency  (SFMTA)Matt  Goyne, Principal - Fehr & Peers Michael Cox,  Principal Sustainability Analyst - San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)When:	Wednesday August 9th, 5:30 -7:30pmWhere:	Port of San Francisco, Pier 1 The Embarcadero, Bayside Room, San Francisco, CA, 94105Cost:		$60 WTS Members / $80 Non-Members / $10 Students or UnemployedFood:		Buffet style dinner & drinks will be providedRSVP:	Please RSVP by August 4 via Eventbrite Here﻿For questions, please email us at ProgramsWTSSanFrancisco@gmail.comEmpowering Women, Transforming Transportation.

Cost: $30 for the full three-part series, and receive a $10 gift card at each workshop. Sponsored by the San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionThe Introduction to Sustainable Gardening series is a three-part workshop series designed to help you transform your yard into a thriving, sustainable garden. This course will teach you everything you need to know to nurture perennial gardens that conserve water, provide beauty, and attract pollinators and beneficial insects.San Francisco is a beautiful and unique city, with year-round mild temperatures and dry, foggy summers. Learn what plants are adapted to our coastal climate and grow without the need for toxic pesticides or large amounts of water. This course will focus on native and drought-tolerant ornamental gardens but will cover broad topics that can also apply to vegetable gardening.The full series is $30, but you will get $10 gift cards to the Urban Farmer Store at each workshop (for a total of $30 in gift cards if you attend the two workshops).Registering will sign you up for the full series of three workshops. Please only register if you plan to attend all three sessions. SERIES SUMMARY: Part I: Sustainable Garden Design  This workshop will teach you how to design a beautiful, functional, and thriving home garden space. San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco’s dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill. Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides. Ellyn will discuss the notion that most plant health problems are caused by poor growing conditions or improper planting, and that pests and diseases may be secondary problems. Plant health care involves a combination of strategies including monitoring, and you'll learn strategies to attract beneficial insects, and keep pests, diseases, and weeds at bay naturally. Instructor Ellyn Shea is a Bay Area gardener, garden coach, Certified Arborist, consultant, and educator. She is a longtime Garden for the Environment teacher and supporter and shares her extensive gardening knowledge in this workshop series.

Pause for a Wine Dinner with Avignonesi,"August 24, 2023, 06:15 PM","August 24, 2023, 09:45 PM","223 East 4th Avenue, San Mateo, CA 94401","Join us as Chef Andrea and his culinary team prepare a five-course tasting dinner to pair with an amazing collection of organic and biodynamic wines from Tuscan winery, Avignonesi. You don't want to miss this special evening!“Healthier wines for healthier people, but also a healthier land and a healthier environment to pass on to future generations.”Avignonesi’s vineyards spread across the picturesque rolling hills of the southeast corner of Tuscany. Avignonesi also owns a vineyard in the neighbouring municipality of Cortona. After a few years as a silent partner, the Belgian Virginie Saverys took over the prestigious winery in 2009. She was a consumer, and overnight she became a producer. This crossing of the mirror motivated Saverys to undertake a radical regeneration of the winery. Safety at work, pollution and climate became Avignonesi’s primary concerns. Out of respect for workers, consumers and the environment, she has banned highly toxic synthetic biocides that poison life, and pollute the soil, the air and the water. Concurrently, she has forbidden the use of commercial yeasts, dyes, enzymes, tannins and other industrial adjuvants in the cellar.Sangiovese, the king grape of Tuscany, accounts for the bulk of the 175 hectares of vineyards. International varieties are also present but mainly in Cortona. Clay is predominant here and the soils are frequently mixed with layers of limestone or sand.  Every single batch is vinified separately before the final selection which determines the blend. Avignonesi claims to be artisans of wine because few winegrowers, even of modest sizes, work on such small lots. The underground fauna and flora help the vines to metabolise the minerals present in the soil. The company strives to restore its native character to better establish the identity of the fruit. Biodynamic viticulture contributes to a large extent in achieving this purpose. Under the guidance of oenologist Matteo Giustiniani, the use of oak is increasingly sparing (especially for Sangiovese). This results in fresher wines, where the fruit aromas are often accompanied by vibrant acidity. The elegant profile and sobriety of the tannins prevail over the power without harming the ageing potential.L﻿imited Tickets Available!T﻿hursday, August 24thCheck In: 6:15pm 																																			S﻿eated for Dinner: 6:30pm (communal tables)$﻿210 per person (gratuity included)MenuFirst Coursered prawn crudo, prawn bisque, peach pure, fines herbes sponge, candied lemon zestAvignonesi Da-Di Toscano I.G.T.

The study of lichens provides Klara with a lifetime of questions, which have taken her across the globe to study lichen ecology and deep down to the microscopic and molecular level to study lichen evolution. Currently Klara is focusing on the ecology and specific adaptations of lichens in extreme environments, and whether these adaptations will help them to weather global climate change. Klara conducted her PhD at Michigan State University, and did a postdoc at The Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, England, before beginning her work at Berkeley.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/friends-of-mt-tam-51629322003,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/go-on-a-lichen-hike-tickets-673399986487,SF

California Burning: The Fall of Pacific Gas and Electric—and What It Means for America's Power Grid is a revelatory, urgent narrative with national implications, exploring the decline of California’s largest utility company that led to countless wildfires—including the one that destroyed the town of Paradise—and the human cost of infrastructure failure.Pacific Gas and Electric was a legacy company built by innovators and visionaries, establishing California as a desirable home and economic powerhouse. In California Burning, Katherine Blunt examines how that legacy fell apart—unraveling a long history of deadly failures in which Pacific Gas and Electric endangered millions of Northern Californians, through criminal neglect of its infrastructure. As PG&E prioritized profits and politics, power lines went unchecked—until a rusted hook purchased for 56 cents in 1921 split in two, sparking the deadliest wildfire in California history.California Burning is a deeply reported, character-driven narrative, the story of a disaster expanding into a much bigger exploration of accountability. It’s an American tragedy that serves as a cautionary tale for utilities across the nation—especially as climate change makes aging infrastructure more vulnerable, with potentially fatal consequences.Katherine Blunt has written about utilities and renewable energy for the Journal since 2018. Her coverage of PG&E, reported in close collaboration with two colleagues, was a finalist for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting and earned a Gerald Loeb award, the highest honor in business journalism. The series also won the 2019 Thomas L. Stokes Award for energy and environmental writing, as well as a silver Barlett & Steele award through the Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism.

We’re bringing an incredible group of entrepreneurs together to share resources and expertise on sustainable fashion so we can all work to reduce the impacts of fast fashion. Discover how shopping and swapping secondhand promotes sustainability by keeping items out of landfills.Bring 5-10 of your best pieces you no longer wear, to swap for new pieces. You can  still join us if you’re a minimalist and are just looking to spend time with our awesome group. You’ll still be invited to join the swap and leave with something new.Why Swap? Clothing has turned into a disposable commodity, directly contributing to climate change, gender inequality, social injustices, The average NYC household throws away about 120 pounds of textiles a year, amounting to approximately 13 Brooklyn Bridges of clothing, shoes, linens, and accessories in total. Additionally, 10 times as much textile waste is being thrown away before consumers see the products.A clothing swap is a gathering of people who exchange their valued but no longer used clothing for “new” clothing they will use from someone else’s wardrobe. These swaps are an impactful and low cost way to extend the life of our clothes, divert textiles from landfills, mix up your wardrobe, and meet like-minded people.BUSINESSES SUPPORTING OUR SWAP:Beni makes shopping secondhand easy with a simple browser plug-in.Dena May Styling offers personal styling with a focus on sustainability and self-body-love to help others step into their authentic expression of themselves.

Also, have you ever thought of Earth as one giant nursery for everyone’s and everything’s spawn, from mites to mice? Well, you will! And if you’ve definitely never considered eating algae to help climate change, well, we can’t say you will…but maybe you’ll be inspired.“Nursery Earth: The Wondrous Lives of Baby Animals (and the Incredible Sacrifices of Their Parents)”By: Danna StaafAt any given moment, most animals on the planet are babies—from chicks and tadpoles to caterpillars and marine larvae. Their tiny, hidden lives reveal some of nature’s strangest workings: A salamander embryo breathes with the help of algae inside its cells. The young grub of a Goliath beetle dwarfs its parents. Mouse embryos can absorb cancerous cell grafts—and develop into healthy adults. At once incredibly vulnerable and incredibly vital, baby animals are not just beings in progress, but beings in their own right. And our planet needs them all: the maggots as much as the kittens! Meanwhile, every animal baby has parents. Whether they stick around to nurse their young or die before their eggs hatch, all animal parents invest in the next generation . . . sometimes in truly bizarre ways, like the caecilian mom who grows an extra “milk skin” or the mama mite who’s literally bursting with pride. Danna Staaf is an author, artist, and marine biologist who earned a PhD from Stanford University with her studies of baby squid. Her writing has appeared in Nautilus, Atlas Obscura, and Science, and her first book, Squid Empire: The Rise and Fall of the Cephalopods, was named one of the best science books of the year by NPR’s Science Friday. Her book for young readers, The Lady and the Octopus: How Jeanne Villepreux-Power Invented Aquariums and Revolutionized Marine Biology (https://lernerbooks.com/shop/show/21976), was listed as a best book of the year by both the School Library Journal and the Children’s Book Committee. Her most recent book, Nursery Earth: The Wondrous Lives of Baby Animals and the Extraordinary Ways They Shape Our World (https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/summer-2023/nursery-earth/), has been called “a gobsmacking delight!” Staaf lives in San Jose, California, with her husband, children, cat, and innumerable plush octopuses.“Super Slime Me or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Live on Algae”By: Elliot RothAlgae enthusiasts and plankton party animals, welcome to the wacky world of green gastronomy! Over the past few weeks, our speaker has been on a wild, strange and sometimes hilarious adventure through the uncharted territory of munching on nothing but algae. He’s been surviving on some slime sublime as a means of investigating the potential of our tiny green friends to meet the challenges of everything from the impending climate catastrophe to life in space. Get ready to dive into weird self-experimentation, the carbon impact of food, and how you too might one day be eating algae on a daily basis.Elliot Roth is the founder of Spira, a company that uses genetically engineered algae grown by a global network of farming partners to make designer materials, starting with natural colors. He is a synthetic biologist with years of experience in product design and storytelling, and previously started 7 companies and 2 nonprofits. In his spare time he plays music, and participates in space analog missions while residing in San Francisco a few blocks from Dolores Park.“The Greatest Pirate Who Ever Lived (A Woman!)”By Christina LiChang Yi Sao or Sek Yeung led thousands of pirates to carve out a community of misfits in the South China Sea.

Youth leadership is real, and it is powerful. Putting them at the seat of change is needed now more than ever. While there is often a misconception that youths are apathetic or are disengaged around climate policy and decision making, this session’s panelists represent just a handful of examples that demonstrate that youths are actually highly engaged and want to be empowered to drive change. This panel discussion aims to highlight some of the work that youths in Singapore are doing to push for policy changes and for impactful action to be taken to protect the Earth and climate.    Moderator: Erin Gunanto, Programme Manager, EB Impact  Panelists: Muhd Nasry, Executive Director, Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity (SYVB)Rishika Selvan, Singapore Youth for Climate ActionAshleen Tan Su Ying, Coastal Ecologist, Surbana JurongLocation: ArtScience Cinema, Level 4For the full festival line-up, click HERE!Please note that there are limited seats to all talks.

By looking at the dates from July to August 2023 alone, we can see that one of the extreme weather events—flash floods—had already happened all around the world with a higher frequency of occurrence and increasing severity.

To me, the root cause of climate change is easily predictable.
For the rest, the root-cause solution is nearly impossible to implement.

During my talk, I will analyze the cause and solution to climate change by using both a technical and philosophical approach so that you can understand climate change from different angles. I will show and prove my prediction that flash floods will continue to happen forever.

Do come and listen to my talk. It is open to anyone who is concerned about the environment, regardless of their background.

Designing for Nature: Ecologically Engineering Artificial Coastal Defences,"August 27, 2023, 02:30 PM","August 27, 2023, 03:30 PM","6 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore, 018974, Singapore","This event is part of the Waves of Change Festival 2023 held at ArtScience Museum on the 5th to 27th of August 2023.Designing for Nature: Ecologically Engineering Artificial Coastal DefencesCoastal urbanisation and climate change are driving the global proliferation of artificial coastal defences. These structures have significant effects on the ecology of marine habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. For example, seawalls are generally homogenous and steep. Due to these differences, artificial defences are poor surrogates for the habitats they replace. Ecological engineering—the integration of ecological principles and engineering for the benefit of both humans and nature—is a form of Nature Based Solution that is being increasingly adopted to alleviate the negative impacts associated with coastal defences by improving their ecological functioning. One of the more successful eco-engineering strategies is to add tiles with complex topographies, microhabitats, and water-retaining features. These can increase the richness and abundance of species reminiscent of native communities. Moving forward, how can we incorporate habitat complexity and green elements into new coastal defence designs, and what additional benefits may they be able to provide?About the host: Dr Peter Todd is an experimental marine ecologist who focusses urban marine systems. He works on increasing understanding of the ecology and functioning of tropical coastal marine organisms and communities under environmental stress. His research is multidisciplinary, synthesising elements of biology, geography and engineering to answer ecological questions. His team has 18 years of experience in the conceptualisation, build, implementation, and analysis of novel experiments, and over a decade designing and testing a wide range of seawall enhancements. Dr Todd is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, where he runs the Experimental Marine Ecology Laboratory and is director of the Bachelor of Environmental Studies programme. He has published over 150 peer-reviewed papers on coastal systems and his lab’s research is featured regularly in both local and international media.

Tentatively titled The Singapore Special: Dog-Fostering and Canine-Human Governance, it focuses on the triangular relationship between the foster-care program in Singapore, the dogs in it, and housing policies. It shows how a landscape of housing regulations has recrafted mongrels as “Singapore Specials” in order to secure their belonging in the city. She looks at the role that fosterers play in reshaping Singapore Specials as “good” canine citizens in order to gain legitimacy not just in the eyes of the state, but also in the community at large.Selected PublicationsChitra V. Drawing Coastlines: Climate Anxieties and the Visual Reinvention of Mumbai’s Shore. Forthcoming.Chitra V.

He received his Ph.D. from the Department of Geography at the University of Oregon and is now an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore. His research examines how geopolitical abstractions like “nation” and “state” emerge through and manifest within the mundane things and banal practices of everyday life. His dissertation analyzed rail infrastructure as key site for the production of nation-ness: the sense of national community which coalesces through the skilled practices of everyday life. He draws on multi-sited and infrastructural ethnographic methodologies to investigate skilled traveling practice, and materialist and affective theory to analyze the more-than-human elements of rail space. His work speaks to three topics of broad interest within human geography: the fractured geographies of nationhood, the theorization of materiality in a more-than-human world, and the political economy of mobility in contemporary China.Closing RemarksNala H.

•	With a resolution on the implementation and delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals, on June 23rd 2022 the European Parliament has recommended The Inner Development Goals as an important framework to achieve the SDGs, “to educate, inspire and empower people to be a positive force for change in society, thereby accelerating progress towards achieving the SDGs"".

Playground session on the ethics of drone design!,"September 26, 2023, 12:30 PM","September 26, 2023, 01:30 PM","5 Jaffalaan, 2628 BX Delft, Netherlands","The monthly playgrounds rotate between faculties. You are cordially invited to the upcoming playground on September 26th: 12.30 – 13.30 at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. This playground is hosted by Salua Hamaza, Assistant Professor in Aerial Robotics, TU Delft Aerospace Engineering & TUD Robotics Institute Aerospace Representative and the Delft Design for Values Institute.We are honored to be joined by Dylan Cawthorne, Associate Professor at the Drone Center at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, who will share insights from his book The ethics of Drone Design.ProgrammeIntroduction Design for values Design for values in (Aerial) robotics The ethics of drone designDiscussion on the ethics/design principles of dronesQ&AA﻿bout Dylan Cawthorne and his book on the ethics of drone designMy name is Dylan Cawthorne, and I am an Associate Professor at the Drone Center at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.  My goal is to make the world a better place using ethics, technology, art, and craft.  I see myself as a champion for the use of ethics and human values in engineering, and as an activist engineer.  My main area of research is using value sensitive design methods and ethical principles to design and build prototype drones - as documented in my PhD thesis and forthcoming book.  These drones are used in humanitarian and public healthcare contexts in Denmark, Africa, and beyond.  I am interested in utilizing art, craft, and creativity to enhance engineering - and engineering to inform art.  A common theme in my work is the support of de-centralized technologies and democratic, grassroots organizations and methods.  In 2021, I won the Inspiration Prize from my university for my work with the United Nations Sustainable Development goals.  You can read more about my background at this link, see an overview of my projects below, and read about my future work at the bottom of this page.This book presents a holistic approach to the design and use of drones. It argues that this powerful technology requires high levels of ethical analysis and responsibility—our moral progress must keep pace with our technological progress.  Drone technologies support and diminish the flourishing of certain human values, impact power relations between individuals and groups, and add an additional element to the complex network of humans and objects in modern society. The book begins by introducing four prototype drones designed and built by the author: the healthcare drone, the search and rescue drone, the mapping drone, and the spiritual drone. After presenting the technological aspects of each drone, the author considers their social contexts and ethical aspects. What is the use plan of each drone? Where will it operate? Will it support the flourishing of humans and of nature? Should this drone be built? The next part of the book showcases several methods used to develop the prototype drones from the fields of engineering, ethics, and art: value sensitive design, ethical frameworks, capability caution, and speculative design. These methods reveal a more subtle and nuanced view of drones than the currently polarized characterization of “the good drone” or “the killer drone”. The book concludes with specific recommendations for drone engineers, companies, lawmakers, and citizens.F﻿urther information can be found here.A﻿bout the Robotics InstituteTU Delft Robotics Institute unites all Delft University of Technology’s research in the field of robotics. Its main challenge is to get robots and humans to work together effectively in unstructured environments, and real settings.Within the institute both the ‘hard’ robot disciplines (mechatronics, embedded systems, control and Artificial Intelligence) and the ‘soft’ robot sciences (human-machine interaction, user interaction, architecture, ethics, security and design) have a prominent presence. By joining forces, and aligning research, education and valorisation, TU Delft Robotics Institute takes a leading role in the creation of the next generation robots.F﻿urther information can be found here.About the Delft Design for Values InstituteDesign for Values is aimed at systematically integrating values of moral importance in the design of products, services and systems from the start of the design process. The institute focuses on a broad range of values including safety, sustainability, privacy, justice & fairness, diversity & inclusion, and well-being, as well as on a wide range of domains and applications areas, like smart cities, healthcare, water management, infrastructure, energy, and consumer products.The Delft Design for Values Institute (DDfV) brings together expertise in design and (moral) values and is a collaboration between five faculties: TPM, IDE, BK, CTIG and EEMCS. DDfV is directed by prof. dr. ir. Ibo van de Poel. The Management Board consists of representatives of the five participating faculties: Carola Hein/Rachel Lee (BK), Edo Abraham (CiTG), Marina Bos–De Vos (IDE), Megha Khosla (EEMCS), and Michael Klenk (TBM) and Marielle Feenstra (TBM – Coordination DDfV), and Maria Novas Ferradas (BK – Coordination DDfV).The institute has formulated the following four ambitions for the next five years:Consolidating DDfV as an international leading knowledge institute in the field of design and values,Acquiring external funding for interdisciplinary research on Design for Values,Integrating Design for Values in educational programs at the TU Delft,Increasing external visibility through an annual theme.For 2023 the annual theme is Design for Justice.If you have questions or are interested in our activities, you can reach us at info@delftdesignforvalues.nlF﻿urther information can be found here ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/design-for-values-institute-63508538483,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/playground-session-on-the-ethics-of-drone-design-tickets-675002389317,Amsterdam

The aim of conflict management is to enhance learning and group outcomes, including effectiveness or performance in an organizational setting.Conflict management is the process by which disputes are resolved, where negative results are minimized and positive results are prioritized. This key management skill involves using different tactics depending on the situation, negotiation, and creative thinking.Conflicts are inevitable when people with different personalities and goals are put together to work in the same environment. Quite often, the clash that results leads to extreme anger and animosity, and this can have a very disruptive effect on the entire team. As a leader, you are often called upon to defuse the situation and resolve differences in a collaborative manner, before the situation spirals out of control.Our one-day Conflict Management and Communication Skills provide you with effective tools to manage stressful situations in the workplace and become a highly successful person and leader. Learn to build conflict resolution techniques that work, and manage complex team dynamics with sensitivity and firmness.Why is conflict management important?When conflict is managed effectively, team members see conflict as a tool to exchange ideas while allowing each party to be equally heard. ""Teams cannot have effective communication without productive conflict."" Adequately managed conflict is an effective form of communication rather than a fearful argument.The conflict management process has steps such as identifying conflicts, analyzing conflict, identifying an alternative solution, applying conflict resolution techniques, choosing the best alternative, implementing the solution, and reviewing the impact.What you will learn:On completion of this course, participants will be able to:Understand why conflicts ariseIdentify common responses to conflicts in terms of behavior, thoughts, and attitudeExplore Aggressive, Passive, and Assertive approaches and the consequence of each responseHow to deal with difficult team membersLearn effective conflict resolution methods and best practices for managing conflictsHow to build trust and credibility with colleagues and team membersLearn to hold difficult conversations calmly and assertivelyCourse Agenda:The training workshop covers the following aspects:The intention behind every conflict-The cause and effect of the conflict.

Get rid of old habits that prevent you from moving ahead. In this millennial generation, cultural differences are inherent. The steps we need to take to fit into this cultural era and adapt to the working environment and varied styles of employeesHow to apply the principles leading to conflict resolution and establish a harmonious working environmentThe 5-step strategy in implementing the blueprint for Conflict ResolutionThe areas that will be examined include:Self-Awareness and Self-ManagementBe aware of the working environment around us EmotionsHow to Manage Our Emotions BetterConflicting StylesWhy are there conflicting styles and how to manage them and collaborateConflicting RolesThe similar roles in the organization that cause conflictsConflicting ResourcesAllocation of resources that trigger conflicts and how to manage themHow to build and sustain relationships with your supervisors, colleagues, and peersThree areas to examine:Breaking Barriers to Effective Communication in a Cross-Cultural Diverse EnvironmentThe Mastery of Building Rapport in the WorkplaceBuild trust and Confidence amongst supervisors, colleagues, and peersWhy global corporates prefer Leaning Zone Inc as their Training PartnerA provider of Enterprise Learning Solutions (ELS), Learning Zone Inc creates industry-fit talents through training, coaching, and consulting by globally-acclaimed trainers.

Self-Love in Nature: Forest Bathing (Spanish & English),"August 26, 2023, 11:30 AM","August 26, 2023, 01:00 PM","south of W 26th, South Chicago Heights, IL 60411","What is forest bathing - Shinrin-yoku? There’s magic in the air when we are in nature. The light through the leaves, the mist floating in the hills, the sound of rushing water, the smell of trees & flowers.  All of it captivates and soothes us—we know this intuitively, though we may not experience it daily. The natural world provides centering, grounding, and calming.Research: Most of us spend the majority of our time disconnected from the wild: Studies reveal that we spend approximately 93 percent of our time indoors—leading to what’s known as nature deficit disorder. Meanwhile, lifestyle-related diseases are the highest causes of death in the West, and they are directly related to the choices we make. But we can reverse this pattern at any time. Are you ready?Research shows that time outdoors is a critical component of overall health, benefiting us physically, mentally, and emotionally, and reconnecting us to our sense of self. This connection expands beyond the natural rhythms of our bodies and the seasons, to our contact with each other and the larger context within which we live—our environment. As the benefits become increasingly clear, doctors are even prescribing time in nature—sometimes known as forest bathing.There have been numerous experiments and field studies conducted and the results have been rosy. Forest bathing has been found to: Help in the regulation of blood pressure (Wen et al., 2019) Be beneficial to a person’s parasympathetic nervous system (sometimes called the rest and digest system), Balance out the sympathetic nervous system (that revs our adrenaline and heartbeat in times of stress),Allows the body to enter a state of relaxation (Farrow & Washburn, 2019).Improve the number of natural killer cells, which protect against disease( by killing virally infected cells )(Yu et al., 2017).Research indicates forest bathing also provides a defense against the pangs of anxiety, stress, depression, and other inflictions on one’s mind. In recognition of its potential to help, Japan has included it in its national health service as an intervention for mental health (Clarke et al., 2021). Shinrin-yoku seems to have a positive impact on post-traumatic stress disorder, has been observed to have benefits for those dealing with insomnia, and has improved the mood of people with unhealthy alcohol use (Antonelli et al., 2021). One study even did something as simple as studying facial expressions and found that people became happier by spending a few hours in the embrace of green (Wei et al., 2020). Such is the power of the forest that even video of it can induce some of the same physical reactions (Hansen et al., 2017).N﻿eed more proof? 😊Our Guide: Alison Paul has more than 15 years of experience strengthening people’s connections to themselves, others, and the place where they live. Alison is a yogi, meditator, an outdoor fanatic, and a certified Forest Therapy Guide through the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy (ANFT), certifying in both Spanish and English.

Anti-American Propaganda & Its Impacts in Taiwan’s Information Environment,"August 09, 2023, 11:00 AM","August 09, 2023, 12:30 PM","1836 Jefferson Pl NW, Washington, DC 20036","The past year has seen ever-growing prominence in Taiwan’s information environment for “America Skepticism Theory” (in Mandarin, “疑美論”): a broad set of narratives that depicts the United States as an unreliable partner for Taiwan, and one that will withdraw its political and security support for Taiwan when it suits US interests to do so. This narrative has its origin in anti-American propaganda produced by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which is intended to undermine the closer relations formed between Taiwan and the United States in recent years. Despite its origins as a hostile propaganda campaign intended to undermine Taiwanese resilience against PRC pressure, “America Skepticism Theory” has emerged in both traditional and online media as a significant factor affecting public discourse in Taiwan regarding its relationship with the United States.Over the course of the past year, the Information Environment Research Center (IORG), a civil society organization based in Taiwan, has been conducting data-focused research into the content and origins of the “America Skepticism Theory” narrative, as well as its impacts on Taiwan discourse and public opinion. The Global Taiwan Institute (GTI) has also been performing research for a separate narrative report on this topic, which is intended to provide illustrative case studies as to how this narrative has affected Taiwan’s information environment. In this launch event and public discussion seminar, each organization will discuss their parallel and complementary reports on this topic: IORG Co-Director Mr. Chihhao Yu will discuss the contents of IORG’s new report US Skepticism and Where It Came From, while GTI Deputy Director John Dotson will provide an overview of GTI’s report Taiwan as the “Abandoned Chess Piece”: “America Skepticism Theory” in Taiwan’s Information Environment. The discussants for this event will also include Dr. Wei-Ping Li, a former journalist in Taiwan and current academic researcher in journalism, who will discuss the presence of disinformation in Taiwan’s media environment; and Mr. Benjamin Sando, a graduate student at Georgetown University who has spent the past year in Taiwan, studying civil society responses to online propaganda and disinformation. The panelist presentations will be followed by an open discussion and audience Q&A, moderated by Mr. Dotson.The event will be held at the GTI office located at 1836 Jefferson Place NW in Washington DC (approximately one block from the Dupont Circle Metro). Doors will open at 10:30 AM, and the event will begin at 11:00 AM. If you plan on attending in-person, please RSVP by August 7th, as seating is limited. A light lunch will be provided. Please direct questions or concerns to Program Manager Marshall Reid at mreid@globaltaiwan.org.**Media: Please contact Marshall Reid at mreid@globaltaiwan.org if you would like to bring additional crew members or equipment, so that we can be sure to accommodate you.The Speakers:Chihhao Yu is a software engineer and information designer, and co-director of the Taiwan Information Environment Research Center (IORG) based in Taipei, Taiwan. Chihhao coordinates scientific research, data engineering, community engagement, and international exchange at the center, directing organizational capacity towards safeguarding election integrity and building democratic resilience in Taiwan. He is also a contributor to g0v (pronounced “gov-zero”), Taiwan’s civic hacking community, and an organizer of Facing the Ocean, a West Pacific civic hacking network.Dr. Wei-Ping Li earned her Ph.D. from the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism. Her research interests include propaganda, social media content moderation, and digital privacy challenges. Prior to entering academia, she worked as a consultant in the field of digital human rights. She has also worked as a journalist for Taiwanese media outlets. Wei-Ping Li received her LL.M. (Master of Laws) from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and has been admitted to the New York State Bar as an attorney to practice law since 2009. Benjamin Sando is a current M.A. student in the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. He has spent the past year in Taiwan as a research fellow with DoubleThink Lab, a civil society organization dedicated to strengthening Taiwan society’s resilience against online disinformation and malign Chinese influence operations. Ben is the current recipient of a Global Taiwan Institute scholarship to support this research work. He has also previously worked and studied in Korea as a research fellow with the Yonsei Institute of Sinology. Speaker/Moderator:J﻿ohn Dotson is the deputy director at GTI. A former US Navy officer and professional staff member of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, he has performed extensive writing and research on a range of political and national security issues related to U.S. policy in East Asia, to include Chinese propaganda and influence efforts, military-civil fusion efforts within the People’s Liberation Army, and patterns in military coercion efforts directed against Taiwan.

If the merger succeeds, the new company would be the second largest grain trading company in the world after Cargill and become a dominant player in wheat and soybean markets. Markets for agricultural inputs like fertilizer and seed are also highly concentrated.Please join us for the fourth seminar of the IFPRI-AMIS series on Making Sense of Food and Agriculture Markets, which will examine whether increased concentration necessarily leads to increased market power or simply reflects the underlying economic efficiencies controlling value chains.

We can’t wait to see you there again this year at the City Club LA in DTLA!(Please note: This event WILL sell out. There is limited capacity in the venue space so we will not be able to accommodate additional parties after we reach ticketing capacity. Please get your tickets early to ensure your attendance! )The Inflation Reduction Act is a win for women. As women make up three quarters of affordable housing residents, the IRA is funding rebates that provide high efficiency alternatives, is reducing the pay gap for medical insurance premiums (where women spend almost double in their percentage of annual income), and reduces the cost of prescription medication for medicare recipients (which is also female majority in percentage).So what are the direct impacts of the IRA in our industry that we should be aware of?The Inflation Reduction Act is the biggest climate investment in history, driving massive reductions in GHG and energy costs of homes and buildings across the U.S. It will transform markets, from sweeping tax incentives and rebates to investments in better building codes and decarbonizing improvements for new and existing structures.We hope to see you there for this panel discussion and community conversation!About the Women in Green Breakfast:A highly-anticipated and annual favorite in our community! The WiG Breakfast has been a yearly occurrence where we gather, meet and mingle, and come together to support the women of our industry. All are welcome to join and we hope to see you there!

Are you concerned about: Improving your propertySaving resources and reducing costsReducing negative impact on the environmentMoving towards green energy production Our key target audience are businesses in retrofit sector and their concerns are different. Some of them are below, to mention a few: Limited public knowledge and engagement on the subjectWillingness to retrofit and trust in the processSupply and demand issuesContractors not knowing the commercial benefit of retrofitSkills shortagesCost of retrofit and limited availability of fundingInconsistent government policy and investment We are particularly going to focus on two challenges around retrofitting.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive [CSRD] has to be incorporated into member state law by 2024, and with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards [ESRS] being adopted in June this year, businesses are scrambling. They need to prepare existing systems and processes or overhaul them completely to produce consistent, comparable, and quality data that is compliant with the regulation. And they need to do this at speed. A lack of clarity as to how the upcoming regulation will impact businesses and what they will be legally obliged to disclose, combined with differing global collection standards and capabilities has meant many are already behind in their preparation for the CSRD. The pressure is building as the risk of not being CSRD compliant increases. On top of this, business must match stakeholder requirements to provide material information that stands up to scrutiny and presented in a coherent, engaging format.At Sustainability Reporting Europe 2023, a part of IMPACT Congress London, we will help you understand how  to utilise systems and processes to provide consistent, comparable, and reliable data in an automated fashion, explore how sustainability can work closer and more effectively together with finance, risk, and legal teams, and how businesses can meet regulatory requirements while not losing sight of the ‘why’ we report.F﻿or more event information, visit the official website here: https://events.reutersevents.com/sustainable-business/reporting-europe?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_campaign=5912",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/reuters-events-65905943663,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reuters-events-sustainability-reporting-europe-2023-tickets-636464230647,London

Davies grew up in the New Forest, and spent her childhood exploring and playing in the woods with her sister. Now, as an artist, she uses photography to examine her relationship with that natural environment, and try to reconnect with the wild landscapes of her youth. Ultimately, can those remembered and imagined places be recaptured?In her new series, ""Chalk Streams"", Davies showcases the importance of one of the world's rarest ecosystems: the chalk stream. Under threat from manmade and environmental stressors, the chalk stream provides a setting for a high biodiversity of plants and creatures, and rival rainforests and coral reefs in their ecological importance. As 85% of chalk streams are found across the UK, it was a natural progression for Davies' body of work. The forest, as a symbol in folklore and human psychology, is richly tapestried within human experience and literature. It is against, and within, this verdant background that Davies explore the natural landscape, and creates a sort of limbo zone between reality and fantasy. The temporary interventions she creates in the forest demonstrate her profound respect and love for this immense biosphere.T﻿he show will coincide with the publication of Ellie Davies' monograph.

Nature & Urbanism,"August 24, 2023, 06:30 PM","August 24, 2023, 07:45 PM","15 River Street, Brooklyn, NY 11249","Domino Park is proud to present a 3-part lecture series examining equity, diversity, & access in public spaces with urbanist & professor Lauren Hudson. Here at the park, we think public spaces can be spaces for engagement, continued education, and discussion; ""Nature & Urbanism"" is part of an initiative to introduce more programming that helps adults learn & grow beyond the classroom.Cities have never been neutral spaces. They are in constant flux and the very embodiment of politics in action. While we’re used to seeing cities as sites of resistance and revolutionary possibility (e.g. Stonewall, Black Lives Matter, Anti-War protests), we tend to overlook the politics of the built environment itself.What makes a space natural or unnatural? And how do you know nature when you see it? These three talks will cover how we’ve created a specter called ‘nature’, and how that creation determines who gets to use, rest, and belong in our cities and our public places.M﻿eet in the seating area next to the Fog Bridge (pier reveal).P﻿resented in partnership with Think Olio: https://www.olio.rsvp/",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/domino-park-66253912513,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nature-urbanism-tickets-668352068027,NYC

Automation Revolution: Securing Modern IT Infrastructure for the Future,"September 26, 2023, 08:00 AM","September 26, 2023, 11:10 AM","581 Orchard Road, Singapore, 238883, Singapore","Automating security posture, reducing risks and managing identity in the multi-cloud environment    The Singapore public sector faces the imperative of understanding the intricacies involved in managing contemporary IT infrastructures that span a diverse array of cloud environments, on-premise systems, and hybrid solutions. This challenge arises due to the swift evolution of the IT infrastructure landscape. The dynamic evolution in the public sector's approach to adopting diverse cloud systems and infrastructure brings forth a set of new challenges. These include ensuring data privacy, seamless integration of different systems, implementing robust security measures, and adhering to stringent data protection regulations. According to the 2023 Thales Cloud Security Report, a concerning fact emerges: merely 41% of organisations have implemented zero trust controls in their cloud infrastructure, leading to data breaches. In light of this, the Singapore public sector must critically reassess its current strategies for securing applications and infrastructure. Within this context, the concept of zero trust security has emerged as a prominent approach, emphasising the crucial need to secure everything based on trusted identities. By adopting an identity-based strategy, zero trust security ensures that access to resources is granted only after proper authentication and authorisation. This approach provides public sector with a strong foundation as they navigate the shift to a multi-cloud environment. It empowers them to confidently migrate and protect their infrastructure, applications, and data, instilling a sense of trust and security throughout the process in cloud-native architectures.   By embracing cloud-native architectures, the public sector can leverage advanced security services offered by cloud providers, such as secure key management and network segmentation, to enhance their security.  Automation solutions will also play a critical role in applying security controls consistently across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, effectively reducing the likelihood of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities. Leverage Automation in IT Security Automation in IT security is centred around its ability to streamline security operations, boost efficiency, and enhance overall security posture. It examines how public sector can leverage automation solutions to streamline various security processes, such as vulnerability scanning, patch management, and incident response. This approach enables the achievement of consistent and reliable outcomes, while also minimising the potential impact of human error. Securing Modern IT Infrastructures With the increasing complexity of modern IT infrastructures, securing and protecting critical assets is of utmost importance. Cutting-edge automation solutions can effectively handle the intricate security requirements of hybrid and multi-cloud environments, providing insights into secure management, threat detection, and incident response. Dynamic Multi-Cloud Solutions In the era of multi-cloud, there has been a significant shift in the locus of control. Instead of relying primarily on physical controls, the emphasis has now moved towards trusted identities. This means that every entity must go through authentication and authorisation processes in order to obtain access to systems or resources. By adopting this identity-based framework, organisations can effectively navigate the complexities of securing dynamic multi-cloud environments while ensuring a higher level of security.  Focusing on the critical aspect of security in modern IT infrastructures and leveraging cutting-edge automation solutions, organisations can unleash the future of secure and transformed IT operations. OpenGov Asia is pleased to invite you to our OpenGov Breakfast Insight, aimed at imparting knowledge on how to thrive in an era of multi-cloud architecture. Delegates will be discussing the best strategies on how to automate, provision, secure, connect, and run cloud infrastructure for the most important applications while improving speed, reducing risks, and optimising efficiencies. This session serves as a great peer-to-peer learning platform to gain insights and practical solutions that enable and empower organisations to successfully adopt a secure cloud operating model, drive reliability, improve cost, and maximise security & governance throughout the multi-cloud architecture.

Simply that our most important task is to get off our present collision course. And who is there to tackle such a task? I think every one of us, whether old or young, powerful or powerless, rich or poor, influential or un-influential.”- E.F. Schumacher. First Annual Small is Beautiful Lecture:The Next 50 yearsOn the 50th anniversary of E.F. Schumacher's seminal work Small is Beautiful, the core idea of his work — a placed-based economy in sync with living ecosystems and social needs — is as urgent and relevant as it has ever been. To honour Schumacher's ideas and move them forward in our time of ecological crisis and economic overreach, we feel the time is right for a Schumacher-inspired center in the Netherlands.  “An ounce of practice is generally worth more than a ton of theory.”With an emphasis on the actionable, we envision a physical transformative space, a LAB, where a diversity of individuals, groups and organisations can explore, build and further the new ideas, social practices, technologies and policies for building a new type of society. The center will draw on the special contributions of arts and culture, economics, ecological sciences, and personal development.To help kick off a wider public consideration of Schumacher NL, we are proud to announce that commons activist and scholar David Bollier will deliver the first annual Small Is Beautiful Lecture at the Kleine Aarde in Boxtel on September 14, 2023.  David is Director of the Reinventing the Commons Program at the Schumacher Center for a New Economics in Massachusetts, United States. De Kleine Aarde, as a contemporary model, breathes Schumacher's work.  Hereby, we cordially invite you to be part of  our common movement. The afternoon is an active invitation to help build Schumacher NL  and will offer room for dialogue, initiative building, and connecting . Please join us.

Het team werd opgericht in 2007 en heeft sindsdien verschillende waterstofraceauto's ontwikkeld en deelgenomen aan verschillende races en evenementen. Aansluitend geven zij een lezing met als thema: ""Driving the energy transition with hydrogen racing"".  Deze lezing wordt gegeven door Eva van der Dijs, teammanager Forze Hydrogen Racing team 17. De Forze VIII is gebaseerd op een bestaande sportwagen. Het is een krachtige raceauto met een waterstofbrandstofcel en een elektrische aandrijving. De brandstofcel zet waterstof om in elektriciteit, waardoor de auto snelheid en vermogen krijgt. Het heeft ook een batterijpakket om energie op te slaan en te gebruiken tijdens acceleratie en piekvermogen.De Forze VIII werd de eerste waterstofraceauto in de geschiedenis die deelnam aan een door de FIA gecertificeerde race. Op 18 augustus 2018 nam ze deel aan de sportdivisie van de Supercar Challenge tegen benzine-aangedreven supercars.In augustus 2019 vierde Forze haar grootste prestatie tot nu toe. De Forze VIII nam opnieuw deel aan de Supercar Challenge tijdens de Gamma Racing Days en eindigde als tweede in onze klasse. Dit succes benadrukte de capaciteit van het team en maakt ons nog enthousiaster over wat de toekomst voor ons in petto heeft.Op het circuit van Zandvoort heeft de Forze VIII het officiële ronderecord voor elektrische sportwagens met 1:55.809 tijdens een test waarbij de omstandigheden verre van ideaal waren.

Voor wie gelden die regels precies, wat houden de regels in en hoe kun je die extra administratieve last het beste opbrengen?  Voor de meesten van ons zijn de richtlijnen nieuw. Bovendien zijn ze niet allemaal even eenvoudig meetbaar te maken. Hoe kun je je voorbereiden op een rapportageverplichting waarvan zelfs de overheid op dit moment nog niet precies weet hoe die er in zijn definitieve vorm uit zal zien? We concentreren ons in deze workshop onder meer op de fasering van de invoering van de nieuwe Europese richtlijnen en op de praktische betekenis ervan. Verder behandelen we de vraag hoe je de invoering van verslaggeving over duurzaamheid het beste kunt aanvliegen.Paul van Geldorp is een inspirerende persoonlijkheid en momenteel de drijvende kracht achter Impact!|circulair.

Na zeven jaar in de bouw- en zeven in de woningcorporatiesector te hebben gewerkt was Jan Willem van 2010 tot 2016 verbonden aan het programma Energiesprong. Een rijksoverheidsprogramma dat werkte aan het  verduurzamingsvraagstuk van de gebouwde omgeving. Hij richtte zich daarbij op het versnellen van innovaties in de bouw- en woningcorporatiesector. Jan Willem is ondermeer bedenker en initiator van de Stroomversnelling. Een initiatief waarbij de bouw- en corporatiesector door middel van innovatie en industrialisatie (goedkoper, beter, duurzamer) woningen renoveren. Jan Willem is één van de oprichters van Factory Zero. Een snelgroeiend bedrijf dat industrieel energiemodules produceert voor zeer energiezuinige woningen.De winst van biobased bouwen voor boer en bouw - Als we de klimaatdoelen van Parijs willen halen én snel 900.000 woningen willen bouwen, dan moeten we de bouwsector, de landbouw en de industrie versneld verduurzamen. Biogrondstoffen vormen hiervoor de sleutel. Jan Willem van de Groep vertelt wat er nodig is om dat voor elkaar te krijgen en op welke manier de bouw en landbouw elkaar wederzijds kunnen versterken bij het bereiken van klimaat- en natuurdoelen. Op dit moment werkt Jan Willem aan: Een programma dat biobased bouwen moet stimuleren, versnellen en opschalen in opdracht van het ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit.Een onderzoek naar digitalisering van de renovatie- en verduurzamingsketen in opdracht van TKI urban energyEen programma voor een verduurzamingsaanpak van particulier woningbezit in opdracht van de Agem en de regio Achterhoek.Een kwartiermakersproject voor de uitrol van de contingentenaanpak voor het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koningkrijsrelaties in opdracht van TKI-urban energyHet opzetten van GIDEON – Building Transition Tribe, een transitiebeweging die koplopers in de bouw moet helpen sneller op te schalen.VISIEDe bouwsector verandert de komende jaren razendsnel. Van een traditionele bouwnijverheid naar een slimme en hoogtechnologische bouwindustrie. Nieuwe (productie) technologieën, (biobased)materialen en software staan aan de basis van nieuwe mogelijkheden. Jan Willem verbindt de opgaven die spelen binnen de overlappende domeinen bouwen, wonen, landbouw en energie met die ontluikende bouwindustrie. De noodzakelijke en onontkoombare beweging naar innovatie en industrialisatie in de bouw  illustreert hij in zijn presentaties.

It was only in the year 2000 they started to remember who they really are through communing with their sacred medicine nixi pae (ayahuasca) within their community. Their identity has since returned after more than the 20 years of prayers and cultural strengthening undertaken by the spiritual leader Ninawá Pai da Mata and his village Novo Futuro, and the communities along the Humaitá River.

Eskawata Kayawai in Kensington - unreleased film from the Amazon,"August 14, 2023, 06:00 PM","August 14, 2023, 09:30 PM","4213 Howard Avenue, Kensington, MD 20895","In collaboration with Global Psychedelic Society and The MoCo Psychedelic Society, come experience the forest and its mystery through this unreleased documentary and 6 years project. An evening produced by Bem-te-vi Produçes in collaboration with IRI - Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative.Eskawata Kayawai - The Spirit of Transformation tells the story of the cultural and spiritual renaissance of the Huni Kuin people from the Brazilian Amazon forest through their cultural practice of nixi pae (@yahuasca).The film’s director Lara Jacoski, will be present to share her backstage insights and stories woven with pictures and anecdotes of her relationship with the guardians of the forest built over six years of the film's production and the transformation they brought to her personal life. As a mediator we will have Joseph Mays - Program Director of Chacruna’s Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative (IRI), a grassroots network of Indigenous community organizations fighting for land, water, food, medicine and culture conducting collaborative research and building connections with Indigenous communities throughout the Americas. This is the only chance to watch the movie which will remain unpublished as we continue looking for distribution partners and festival screenings. Such a film has never been done before with the Huni Kuin allowing their lives to be recorded in such a way, making this a unique opportunity to witness their wisdom and traditions.T﻿he doors open at 6pm and there will be a display of indigenous art. The screening will begin at 6:30pm with an introduction of Joseph Mays together with the director's storytelling behind the scenes, after the movie we will have a Q&A.This is a fundraising event to finance our next project ""Living Libraries"", a docu-series to document ancient knowledge from First Nations of Latin America in order to safeguard endangered wisdom for the next generations and humanity as a whole, focusing on elders and their knowledge of sacred plants and rituals. Eskawata Kayawai - The Spirit of Transformation is a message of hope, an example for the world, a powerful return home illustrating the possibility of rescuing ancestral values and living in harmony with ourselves and the planet. It is a valuable lesson in our current need for cultural preservation and sustainability, and re-connecting to our true nature. A breath of hope for all of us living in this post-pandemic era.Get to know more about the film at its website or instagram.Also learn here about all first nation projects from Bem-te-vi Cultural Productions.*﻿Synopsis: In the heart of the Amazon Rainforest, the self-claimed Huni Kuin (meaning true people) are experiencing a renaissance of their culture, after decades of slavery and being forbidden to live their identity. It was only in the year 2000 they started to remember who they really are through communing with their sacred medicine nixi pae (ayahuasca) within their community. Their identity has since returned after more than the 20 years of prayers and cultural strengthening undertaken by the spiritual leader Ninawá Pai da Mata and his village Novo Futuro, and the communities along the Humaitá River. Through this film, we are guided by the villagers through the enchanting cacophony of the forest, understanding the significance of culture and identity to the Huni Kuin people.Speaker: Lara Jacoski is a documentarist, co-director of Bem-te-vi Produções together with Patrick Belem since 2012, a Brazilian independent film production company making collaborations across 5 continents. Lara has deepened her work in ethnographic projects focused to register culture referring to ancestral knowledge. For the past years she has focused to learn and work with the first nations in Brazil such as Guarani, Yawalapiti, Xavante, Kuikuro, Karajá and Huni Kui which she has recently finished the feature and 6 years project Eskawata Kayawai for a US premiere at the PS2023 MAPS Conference. This coexistence with indigenous peoples has changed her life and ways of perceiving reality, cultivating a spiritual depth through her work. Her current project ""Living Libraries"" focuses on documenting endangered wisdom from first nations in Brazil and beyond.S﻿peakers: Joseph Mays received his MSc in Ethnobotany from the University of Kent researching responses to globalization by the Yanesha of central Peru. Graduating with biology and anthropology degrees from Virginia Commonwealth University, he published a medicinal plant guide for the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve in the Ecuadorian cloud forest. Joseph also holds a certificate in Psychedelic Assisted Therapies from Naropa University, and his conservation work explores how cultural-conditioning influences approaches to biocultural sustainability. His Indigenous rights advocacy stresses the importance of ground-up structures that emphasize local agency and challenge conventional philanthropic models in attempts to support Indigenous autonomy and biodiversity. Joseph is Program Director of Chacruna’s Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative (IRI), where he partners with Indigenous community organizations throughout the Americas to support Chacruna’s mission of increasing cultural reciprocity in the psychedelic space, raising unconditional funding and engaging with local stakeholders on their own terms.Collab - The MoCo Psychedelic Society is an open organization dedicated to facilitating the safe emergence of psychedelics through education and meet-ups in Montgomery County, Maryland.

An Evening w/ Katherine Miller for AT THE TABLE: A CHEF'S GUIDE TO ADVOCACY,"September 28, 2023, 07:00 PM","September 28, 2023, 08:30 PM","3064 Mount Pleasant Street Northwest, Washington, DC 20009","ABOUT AT THE TABLE:When Katherine Miller was first asked to train chefs to be advocates, she thought the idea was ludicrous. This was a group known for short tempers and tattoos, not for saving the world. But she quickly learned that chefs and other leaders in the restaurant industry are some of the most powerful forces for change in our troubled food system. Chefs are leading hunger relief efforts, supporting local farmers, fighting food waste, confronting racism and sexism in the industry, and much more.In At the Table, Miller shares the essential techniques she developed for the James Beard Foundation’s Chefs Boot Camp for Policy and Change. Readers will learn how to focus their philanthropic efforts; pinpoint their audience and develop their argument; recruit allies and support action; and maybe most importantly, grab people’s attention in a crowded media landscape.Miller also shares the moving stories of chefs who used these skills to create lasting change. Tom Colicchio became one of the word’s most respected voices on ending hunger. Bakers Against Racism recruited more than 3,000 people to participate in their global bake sales. Chefs from around the country pushed Congress to provide financial relief to the restaurant industry at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.At the Table is filled with inspiration for anyone who has ever wanted to make a difference outside the four walls of their restaurant. And most importantly, it offers proven methods to become a successful advocate. You don’t have to be a celebrity chef to change the food system; you just need the will and the tools in this unique guide.A﻿BOUT KATHERINE MILLER:Katherine Miller helps organizations develop strategic programs and communications to achieve their mission and desired impact. She is an expert in helping foundations, nonprofits, and socially responsible companies connect with consumers, activists, and other partners to drive lasting change.Since 2012, Katherine has focused on the interdisciplinary practices of politics, policy, advocacy, sustainability, and gender bias in the global food system. She developed a series of impact-focused programs for the James Beard Foundation, served as the founding executive director for the Chef Action Network, and developed the Chefs Boot Camp for Policy and Change. Named an industry leader and “Fixer” by Grist 50 and called one of the most innovative women in food and beverage by Fortune and Food & Wine magazines, Katherine is the first food policy fellow at American University’s Sine Institute for Policy and Politics.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/bold-fork-books-36931109723,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/an-evening-w-katherine-miller-for-at-the-table-a-chefs-guide-to-advocacy-tickets-692597727447,DC

Art Opening | Mother Earth: Fine Fibers from the Middle of the Americas,"August 10, 2023, 06:00 PM","August 10, 2023, 07:30 PM","7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, MD 20814","A﻿BOUT THE EXHIBITIONMother Earth Fine Fiber Art from the Middle of the Americas From the middle of the Americas, its terraced mountains to its rainforest rivers, we present exquisite fiber works by artists who celebrate Mother Earth. The organic and upcycled materials show their reverence for the environment, and remind us just how essential this region is to the world’s well-being.Our walls are alive with rugs from Guatemala’s northern highlands, where Maya women pay ancestral homage to the natural world, turning out elegant designs with a contemporary twist. Flying around the gallery is a large flock of sculpted and woven bird masks from Panama’s Emberá tribes, created to summon healing and cleansing spirits; they keep company with sleek rare wood bird mobiles from Colombian carvers. Our smallest works are Wounaan, deep in the Darien Gap, where expert hand and needle weavers celebrate botanicals with elegant and finely stitched Hösig Di baskets.  Each of these artists lives in a different area, yet all are part of what’s called the “natural lung” of North and South America. Since tectonic shifts formed the Panama Isthmus three million years ago,a connecting land mass between the Americas, it has become the essential biological bridge between the continents, attracting migrating air, land and seaborn species unlike anywhere in the world.  But profound pressures put the very existence of these artists and their environments at great risk. For millennia, Indigenous tribes have been the stewards of their land. But they are up against big players, with little to protect the pristine terrain from indiscriminate corporations intent on stripping forests and dumping toxins, nor from the drug-, gun- and human-trafficking gangs that rip through local communities causing irreparable damage. Violent intrusion here is a way of life. Remarkably, artists divine beauty from their volatile surroundings, until they cannot. This exhibition is a curated collection from the textile artists of Multicolores, Emberá and Wounaan basket weavers, wood carvers Juan Carlos Arango & Angela Matiz, and Casanare paper sculptors. Join us Thursday, August 10th from 6pm to 7:30pm for the Opening. FEATURED ARTISTSEmberá and Wounaan weavers hail from two tribes that once seamlessly populated Colombia’s Chocó river systems, a part of what the United States later carved up to establish Panama in 1903, and by 1914, the Panama Canal. Today’s Panamanian Emberá live in the Darien Gap. Like their tribal cousins in the Chocó rainforest, they are the most talented weavers in the world, creating vessels and ritual bird masks from the wilds of Panama, which claim over a thousand different species. Their medium is prized new fronds that sprout from the tops of impossibly tall, spikey black palms. For pigment, the artists rely on abundant seeds, fruits, insects, bark, leaves, mud and ash from the forest.While the black palm baskets take months to make and are astoundingly beautiful when finished, they’re soon put to work in daily life, holding what’s foraged from the forest, containing the day’s river catch… The smallest baskets, the precise, truly minute hand and needlework called Hösig Di, require even more dexterity, and more specialized skills. Like other creatives in the rainforest, Hösig Di artists devote all of their designs to the botany that surrounds them.The tribes, along with the fauna, the flora and the rest of the ecosystem, are compromised as clear-cutting mining companies grab and corrode the soil, water and air; and armed militias rage through the jungle, targeting women to rape and patriarchs to kill. Indigenous tribes here face extinction. From their once-vibrant small communities of stilted houses, tens of thousands have uprooted from their Pacific coastal jungle to landlocked cities already teeming with millions of unhoused residents. Widely regarded as world class, these artists gain the recognition they deserve while they continue to lose the resources they need to create.Multicolores’ master Maya artists work to change the  equation, tapping into their own talent and elevating their families along with their communities. They have become the region’s most successful artrepreneurs, selling extraordinary works for some of the globe’s most discerning textile collectors. Drawing on centuries of Maya weaving cultural identity and pride into their own blouses, or huipiles, and other traditional Mayan dress, or indumentaria maya, they divine crisp, contemporary, and vibrant designs for their wall and floor covers. It starts local and goes global: villages all have distinct patterns and hues that reflect their identity, but Mother Earth centers their Maya worldview rich with legend and folktale.Each configuration, each striking coloration is emblematic of Kiche, Kaqchiquel and Tzutujil communities that climb Guatemala’s rugged, volcanic mountainside. Using rich, sometimes vivid, sometimes understated tones, she plays on sophisticated mastery of color. Her favored fauna and floral designs, her innovative use of recycled materials – strips of stretchable second-hand tee shirts – builds on a legacy of sustainability and stewardship of the land.These fine art rugs tell the stories of triumphs and endurance. Having fled or fully avoided lives of abuse, the talented young artists are cultivated members of Multicolores, a homegrown cooperative where they share techniques and supplies, pool efforts and profits. The women and their families even have a roving healthcare van, a marvel in a medical desert like these rugged hills. As able income earners, they have become standouts in a region of deep poverty and harsh violence, where women and girls suffer one of the worst femicide rates in the world and where adolescents often become mothers before they learn to care for themselves. These artists portend social change, elevating their own self-worth and their importance in the community. Their income affords school uniforms for children, the family access to running water, and a protein diet. “These rugs signify our culture, but also our efforts—how we have worked hard to get ahead,” says artist Ramona Cristina Tumax Tzunún, adding “The rugs are part of us: part of our struggle to be valued, respected and recognized.” In addition to exhibitions in Central America, the United States and Canada, where they have made their way into the finest private collections in the hemisphere, Multicolores’s work has been installed in the permanent collection of the US Embassy in Guatemala City. Juan Carlos Arango and Angela Matiz are Colombian wood carvers who use precious native woods leftover from wooden flooring, roofing, and industrial processes to create their winged mobiles. Ebony, Trupillo, Corazón, Guayacán, Nazareno, and Poui trees provide the woods, which the artists sculpt to highlight the grains, burls and colors. They finish each piece off with linseed oil to moisturize and seal the fibers. The definition of sustainable artists, they give their discarded wood to other local creators who use it to make jewelry and other accessories. Looking ahead, Arango and Matiz started a tree conservation and replacement project in Colombia to assure there is enough ground cover for a healthy bird population.Casanare in Colombia’s eastern region is rugged and wild, and runs as far as the eye can see. It is chock filled with animals who are farmed and far more who roam free. The roosters, oxen, pigs and more are the work of a talented local artist Martha who saw recycled paper, newsprint and egg cartons as a way to feed her children, and ultimately, send them to Bogotá to study.Using opposition newspapers and printed poetry from her region to sculpt animals, she finishes them with fabulous chaquira or beaded designs with the assistance of local artist.L﻿earn More: www.amykaslowgallery.comF﻿ollow us on Instagram: @AmyKaslowGallery",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/amy-kaslow-gallery-30774286548,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/art-opening-mother-earth-fine-fibers-from-the-middle-of-the-americas-tickets-692103739917,DC

Web developers interested in understanding more about sustainable web design and any non-developers who want to help their businesses improve their website’s carbon footprint.  

Why are we running it?If the internet was a country, it would be the 4th largest polluter. 
There is no doubt that our planet is in a climate crisis, and we are the problem. However, many people are forgetting about digital sustainability and how much of an impact the internet has on the environment. 
As web developers, we can help make a difference by building websites sustainably. 
This event is about meeting like-minded individuals who want to make a change, no matter how small. 
We will be hosting a discussion with Tom and Vineeta Greenwood from Wholegrain Digital, a certified B Corp, who are probably the country’s leading agency in this area. 
Tom Greenwood is also the author of the book Sustainable Web Design, of which we will be giving away a couple of copies on the day. 
The event will be hosted by Sabrina Chevannes, the founder of Complex Creative – an agency also dedicated to helping businesses lower their digital carbon footprint. 

This event has also been designed with sustainability in mind, with vegan catering, plastic-free and any carbon used is offset with Ecologi.

What would education at Imperial look like if we took the sustainable development goals seriously and prepared our students to create the future we need, including tackling challenges we don’t yet understand? 2. Creating a climate and nature positive campus. Our current campuses and ways of working are not yet net zero, climate resilient or nature positive, but we want them to be. What would it take from us all to transform Imperial College London to become a sustainable and resilient organisation we can all be proud of? How will the day work?Come along with a topic that you’re passionate about and would love to discuss with others. You can pitch the idea on the day or start the conversation beforehand by joining our Your Priorities group or taking our survey. Anybody can pitch an idea, but you’ll only have one minute to do so! We’ll have time and space to discuss 15 facilitated topics. You’ll help to choose those topics on the day. Of course, this is your conference and informal breakouts are encouraged! Notes from each session will be written up as we go using a crowd-sourced editor. These will be used to help influence College strategy. We want everybody who comes along to feel safe and respected. We’ve suggested some guidelines. Sharing: Come prepared to share your ideas, knowledge, thoughts, questions and challenges. Be brave. Receiving: Listen graciously to others. Value all contributions. Value the individuals contributing. Welcome constructive challenge and new perspectives, even if uncomfortable - be curious! Trust: Trust each other to come from the right place and do the right thing. Trust yourself. Responsibility: This is your event. The ways in which you contribute will influence the success of the day. Take responsibility for yourself, fellow participants, and the discussion topics.

Through a residency program, exhibitions and campaigns in the Kunsthalle Rostock as well as in the Botanical Garden Rostock, a dynamic and experimental platform was created and presented in 2022. Artists and scientists initiated an exchange of research, experiences and ambitions in the form of exhibitions and discussions. The aim now bringing the exhibition to Troy House Art Foundation London in a new version. Today, more and more people around the globe are directly impacted by climate change. Due to this, the perception of this topic has increased and it determines current discourses in many areas of life. As the basis for all its programmes, Troy House Art Foundation is initiating exhibitions, artists’ residencies and exchanges, performances, conversations, educational programmes, and other public and community events. What they hold in common is their identification of art with social, ethical and scientific concerns, and their use of historic buildings, sites, and special natural settings, as integral elements for the production and display of contemporary art.The exhibition On Water & Plants - Artistic Positions on Sustainability, presents  24 artists from different countries and generations in dialogue: Eva & Adele, Germany / Francisco de Almeida, Brazil / Caetano Dias, Brazil / Jaider Esbell, Brazil / José Gomes, Brazil / Rhys Himsworth, England/Germany / Sandra Vásquez de la Horra, Chile/Germany / Ingar Krauss, Germany / Alejandro Lloret, Cuba/Brazil / Paulo Neves, Brazil / Luiz Moreira, Brazil / Giacomo Orth, Germany / Jina Park, South Korea/Germany / Veronika Pfaffinger, Germany / Luzia Simons, Brazil/Germany / Vivan Sundaram, India /Armarinhos Teixeira, Brazil / Tomoyuki Ueno, Japan/Germany / Kiyomi + Tetsuhiro Uozumi, Japan/Germany /Bruno Vilela, Brazil /Thomas Wrede, Germany The show guides the visitors with current artistic confrontations related to nature in the form of installations, objects, paintings, sculptures, photographs and site-specific works focused on five topics – On The Fascination of Nature, In Symbiosis with Nature, Analysis of Nature, Exploration of Nature and The Perception of Nature. Human-induced climate change plays a greater role and impacts not only in the countryside but also in urban habitats. Scientists and artists currently accompany this scenario and the associated future global demands on humanity, as well as the development of adaptation and solution strategies and will continue to do so in the future. The perception of nature alone is not sufficient but is crucial for changing the way we interact with it. What would be effective is a transformative change in the way society thinks and acts. The future depends on a functioning eco-humanism in interaction with different sustainability-oriented world views.  On Water & Plants - Artistic Positions on Sustainability is one more step in this journey.[1] Luzia Simons: Stockage 118, 2011. Courtesy of the artist.

RESTORATION LONDON Sashiko+Boro - Japanese Mending Workshop,"September 10, 2023, 01:00 PM","September 10, 2023, 03:00 PM","Lockwood Way, London, E17 5RB, United Kingdom","Sashiko means ""little stabs"" in Japanese or ""little pierce"" and is a form of decorative reinforcement stitching that started out of practical need during the Edo era (1615-1868) in Japan. Traditionally used to reinforce points of wear or to repair worn places or tears with patches, making the piece ultimately stronger and warmer. Worn out clothes were pieced together to make new garments by using simple running stitches. These clothes increased their strength with this durable embroidery. Boro is very close to Sashiko, both use white thread on indigo and both are mending techniques but boro meaning “rags” or “tattered cloth,” refers to textiles that have been patched many times, so giving a far less structured effect. This sturdy method makes both Boro and Sashiko perfect for mending denim.WHAT YOU WILL LEARN..During this 2 hour workshop you will be given an introduction in to the traditional Japanese method of mending- using Sashiko and Boro embroidery, using beautiful fabrics as patches to fix any holes in your clothing and to create beautiful traditional designs.You will leave feeling inspired to continue fixing and rejuvenating your favourite pieces at home!This will be a hand sewing class, so no need to be a pro on the sewing machine! Which means you will be able to learn the techniques and continue to fix your clothing in the comfort of your own home.Feel free to bring an item of clothing to mend!

Where does it go, and who deals with it when it gets there? In Wasteland, award-winning journalist Oliver Franklin-Wallis takes us on an eye-opening journey through the global waste industry. From the mountainous landfills of New Delhi to Britain’s overflowing sewers, from hollowed-out mining towns in the USA to Ghana’s flooded second-hand markets, we meet the people on the frontline of our waste crisis – both those being exploited, and those determined to make a difference. On the way, we discover the corporate greenwashing that started the recycling movement; the dark truth behind our second-hand donations; and come face to face with the 10,000-year legacy of our nuclear waste. Both shocking and hopeful, Wasteland is the timely and ultimately human story at the heart of an urgent global issue.P﻿lease note that the Zero venue might be moving and the venue might change.

Bitcoin Mining in Quebec: Powering Innovation & Economic Growth,"September 21, 2023, 01:00 PM","September 21, 2023, 05:00 PM","1000 Rue de La Gauchetière O #2100, Montréal, QC H3B 4W5, Canada","Overview:  Quebec’s status as an early Canadian leader in Bitcoin mining development has led to diverse benefits like new provincial revenue, technology innovation, and a growing ecosystem of disruptive blockchain and financial services companies. With a rapid expansion predicted for Web3 platforms and energy-intensive technologies like AI, the province’s mining sector could play a strong role in developing the data centre infrastructure that will help Quebec stay competitive in the new digital economy. Mining is about so much more than just Bitcoin – join the Canadian Blockchain Consortium’s Montreal event to discover the opportunities created by the mining industry and what it could mean to Quebec’s digital future.  Panel Topic: Mining Data Centres as an Economic DriverSynopsis: Successful Bitcoin mining hubs have discovered that the benefits of the industry extend beyond the establishment of profitable companies. In regions like Texas, mining firms have rejuvenated post-industrial towns, created high-value jobs and educational programs, and supported the development of important infrastructure and civic services, ranging from roads to community centres. Join this expert panel to learn why miners have a vested interest in long-term relationships, and how the ecosystems of blockchain companies that form around them can help transform municipalities into innovation hubs. Panel Topic: Leveraging Bitcoin Mining ConvergenceSynopsis: The true power of Bitcoin mining is in its convergence with key industries. In Quebec, mining data centres can play an important role in making renewables more profitable, increasing the sustainability of agriculture, and supporting the growth of disruptive digital companies that will benefit the province’s global competitiveness. In other parts of the world, mining has been an accelerant for green infrastructure development and a valuable revenue source for electricity grids due to its flexibility as a power consumer.

Altovise has over 20 years of experience guiding in NYC, and has called Harlem home since she first moved to the city. “I was drawn to Harlem in the 6th grade… we had to learn a Langston Hughes poem. Mine was ” Mother to Son”.

Civic Art Lab 2023: Waste/ Chemicals/ Water | Sustainability and Design Lab,"October 28, 2023, 11:00 AM","October 29, 2023, 07:00 PM","70 East 4th Street, New York, NY 10003","Civic Art Lab 2023 (in-person location in Manhattan to be announced) Our 9th annual Civic Art Lab considers creative interventions in the management of waste, chemicals and hazardous materials, and water. Urbanization, population growth, and climate change have led to challenges with solid and hazardous waste generation and disposal, and has put stress on water resources. This year’s lab investigates the ways that designers, artists, creative technologists, policy makers, activists, and educators are working to deal with these impacts and what projects are being undertaken to mitigate these risks. The statistics outline a worsening situation.Globally the average person generates 1.6 lbs of waste per day and total waste will rise as the world’s population increases. Even as waste treatment methods have improved, a lot of waste ends up in dump sites and only “20 percent of waste is recycled each year” (Alves, 2023). Hazardous waste, which is especially harmful – coming from dyes, metals in batteries and electronics, and solvents – suffers from inadequate household awareness and lack of industry compliance. Clean water and water systems are taken for granted in many parts of society just as many rivers and lakes have “dried up” or have become “too polluted to use” — and it is expected that by 2025, “two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages.” (WWF, 2023).

More information on speakers and event still to come.Responsible Fashion: Re-Fashioning Your Future in Conscious Consumption…The Resale of ClothingLearning the tenants of responsible fashion with low waste livingSPEAKERS: Haley Lieberman and Laurine Grere OsborneCome join what is certain to be a lively conversation on how two CT-based market leaders have navigated the fragmented landscape and value of sustainable fashion’s clothing resale sector.  From supply chains and related “reverse logistics” in clothing resale, to changing behavior in conscious consumption habits, and a massive clothing waste crisis that has spread around the world.  Diverse Topics of Impact will include:  1) Learn a fascinating update on the clothing materials that directly affect this industry’s over production issues, and what is being done to reduce the production of manufacturing too much clothing!  It starts with readapting materials with a new purpose of usage...that covers the mass-market to luxury sustainable fashion. 2) Understanding today’s evolving definition of “conscious resale” -  what is trending as the most sought-after resold or readapted clothing materials?   Where can you buy or sell them, what is the pricing model for sellers?3) Far beyond clothing materials, discover how responsible fashion has inspired proven behavioral change within the much-touted “low waste, circular” lifestyle.  Who is the customer and what have they changed in their consumption habits…not just in keeping their clothes longer, but also in overall lifestyle… in and out of the home.4) Global Clothing Waste Crisis – find out how our overburdened U.S. landfills are handling 10+ million tons of annually thrown out clothes, (they are not biodegradable), and where they are also shipped these materials internationally, e.g Ghana and other third world countries.5) Buzzwords of the Decade - Sustainability, Regeneration, Net Zero, Low Waste Living, Conscious Living…how are they differently defined?  And who are the major brands leveraging these terms in what remains a small niche sector of their overall clothing business…think Patagonia, Allbirds, LVMH/Nona…and many more.QUESTIONS?

Eskawata Kayawai in Brooklyn NYC - unreleased film from the Amazon,"August 20, 2023, 05:00 PM","August 20, 2023, 08:30 PM","510 Flatbush Ave Brooklyn, New York, NY 11225","In collaboration with Global Psychedelic Society and Gaia NoMaya, come experience the forest and its mystery through this unreleased documentary and 6 years project. An evening produced by Bem-te-vi Produçes in collaboration with IRI - Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative.Eskawata Kayawai - The Spirit of Transformation tells the story of the cultural and spiritual renaissance of the Huni Kuin people from the Brazilian Amazon forest through their cultural practice of nixi pae (@yahuasca).The film’s director Lara Jacoski, will be present to share her backstage insights and stories woven with pictures and anecdotes of her relationship with the guardians of the forest built over six years of the film's production and the transformation they brought to her personal life. As a mediator we will have Joseph Mays - Program Director of Chacruna’s Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative (IRI), a grassroots network of Indigenous community organizations fighting for land, water, food, medicine and culture conducting collaborative research and building connections with Indigenous communities throughout the Americas. This is the only chance to watch the movie which will remain unpublished as we continue looking for distribution partners and festival screenings. Such a film has never been done before with the Huni Kuin allowing their lives to be recorded in such a way, making this a unique opportunity to witness their wisdom and traditions.T﻿he doors open at 5pm and there will be a display of indigenous art. The screening will begin at 5:30pm with an introduction of Joseph Mays together with the director's storytelling behind the scenes, after the movie we will have a Q&A.This is a fundraising event to finance our next project ""Living Libraries"", a docu-series to document ancient knowledge from First Nations of Latin America in order to safeguard endangered wisdom for the next generations and humanity as a whole, focusing on elders and their knowledge of sacred plants and rituals. Eskawata Kayawai - The Spirit of Transformation is a message of hope, an example for the world, a powerful return home illustrating the possibility of rescuing ancestral values and living in harmony with ourselves and the planet. It is a valuable lesson in our current need for cultural preservation and sustainability, and re-connecting to our true nature. A breath of hope for all of us living in this post-pandemic era.Get to know more about the film at its website or instagram.Also learn here about all first nation projects from Bem-te-vi Cultural Productions.*﻿Synopsis: In the heart of the Amazon Rainforest, the self-claimed Huni Kuin (meaning true people) are experiencing a renaissance of their culture, after decades of slavery and being forbidden to live their identity. It was only in the year 2000 they started to remember who they really are through communing with their sacred medicine nixi pae (ayahuasca) within their community. Their identity has since returned after more than the 20 years of prayers and cultural strengthening undertaken by the spiritual leader Ninawá Pai da Mata and his village Novo Futuro, and the communities along the Humaitá River. Through this film, we are guided by the villagers through the enchanting cacophony of the forest, understanding the significance of culture and identity to the Huni Kuin people.Speaker: Lara Jacoski is a documentarist, co-director of Bem-te-vi Produções together with Patrick Belem since 2012, a Brazilian independent film production company making collaborations across 5 continents. Lara has deepened her work in ethnographic projects focused to register culture referring to ancestral knowledge. For the past years she has focused to learn and work with the first nations in Brazil such as Guarani, Yawalapiti, Xavante, Kuikuro, Karajá and Huni Kui which she has recently finished the feature and 6 years project Eskawata Kayawai for a US premiere at the PS2023 MAPS Conference. This coexistence with indigenous peoples has changed her life and ways of perceiving reality, cultivating a spiritual depth through her work. Her current project ""Living Libraries"" focuses on documenting endangered wisdom from first nations in Brazil and beyond.S﻿peakers: Joseph Mays received his MSc in Ethnobotany from the University of Kent researching responses to globalization by the Yanesha of central Peru. Graduating with biology and anthropology degrees from Virginia Commonwealth University, he published a medicinal plant guide for the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve in the Ecuadorian cloud forest. Joseph also holds a certificate in Psychedelic Assisted Therapies from Naropa University, and his conservation work explores how cultural-conditioning influences approaches to biocultural sustainability. His Indigenous rights advocacy stresses the importance of ground-up structures that emphasize local agency and challenge conventional philanthropic models in attempts to support Indigenous autonomy and biodiversity. Joseph is Program Director of Chacruna’s Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative (IRI), where he partners with Indigenous community organizations throughout the Americas to support Chacruna’s mission of increasing cultural reciprocity in the psychedelic space, raising unconditional funding and engaging with local stakeholders on their own terms.[﻿Film Main Credits]Director : Lara Jacoski and Patrick BelemD.O.P : Lara Jacoski and Patrick BelemIn association with: Ninawá Pai da Mata and Txai Vinícius Yube Ika Ni BaiProduction: Bem-te-vi ProduçõesCo-Producer : Joakim Vocke Hauge (Hinterland)Executive producer: Oona Chaplin (Double Rainbow Productions), Torstein Grude (Piraya), Alex Moreno (Cine-Creative Media)Co-executive producers: Lucía Alonso, Bodhi Kaya, Coco Amos and Kristen NicoleSound: Origens Sound Farm – Andreia FreireM﻿usic: The Huni Kuin PeopleMain cast: Ninawá Pai Da Mata, Ikamuru Huni Kuin, Yube Dua Bake, Txana Tuwe, Dua Buse Dua Bake / Huni Kuin indigenous people.This work received grants from the Brazilian Show Me The Fund (powered by Brazilian Content, Cinema do Brasil, Projeto Paradiso) plus a 2 years support of international collective funding from kind souls all over the world.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/lara-jacoski-67677790373,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/eskawata-kayawai-in-brooklyn-nyc-unreleased-film-from-the-amazon-tickets-690311629667,NYC

Our programming is designed to encourage deep connections between attendees and help answer hard questions about textile-derived ocean pollution (i.e. microfiber pollution), climate change, textile waste, green chemistry, ocean-thoughtful material alternatives, and more.  This year's Textile X Ocean Connector Sail will be 5 hours - allowing time for educational programming, connecting deeply, and putting up the sails to enjoy some sailing! Participants will have the option to assist with sailing, or we welcome you to sit and enjoy the view. The longer sail will allow us to spend more time outside of the Golden Gate Bridge and see more of the San Francisco Bay! Educational activities include demonstrations of marine research techniques and participation in ""Educational Tastings"" - a series of short expert presentations that inspire conversation and discussion. Our tastings are facilitated by leaders at the intersection of Textile X Ocean with diverse backgrounds and a passion for knowledge-sharing.On board, you will learn how microfiber pollution is measured, what we know about the potential sources and pathways for fiber pollution in our region, discuss solutions at the forefront of our Textile X Ocean community, and upcoming ways to get involved in furthering research and solutions.Lisa Erdle, 5 Gyres Director of Science and Innovation joined the 2022 sail to help lead a demonstration on techniques to monitor microfiber pollution in water bodies.

With Krystle's background in materials innovation and sustainable textile systems, and Carolynn's background in ocean conservation and plastic pollution, this program merges both of their worlds and expertise.  From hosting an 85 person workshop with NOAA's Marine Debris Program in 2020 and co-authoring the ""California Microfiber Update: Textile Perspective"" to recently co-authoring a congressional report, The Report on Microfiber Pollution, with the EPA Trash Free Waters Program and NOAA's Marine Debris Program on behalf of the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC), Krystle and Carolynn have been able to bring together key learnings from science, industry, government and academia to improve communication cross-discipline and advance toward solutions. In May 2021, Carolynn and Krystle hosted an experiential sail program with local non-profit Fibershed on ""Building Regional Textile Systems For Healthy Soils and Healthy Seas"" on the Call of the Sea's Matthew Turner.  The success of this program was featured in the special Marine Pollution issue of ECO Magazine in October of 2021.From 2021-2022, Carolynn and Krystle served as advisors for the Conservation X Labs Microfiber Innovation Challenge supporting transformative innovations targeting microfiber pollution upstream within the textile industry. I﻿n October 2022, Carolynn and Krystle hosted the inaugural Textile X Ocean Connector sail that brought together 65 participants from more than 35 organizations to participate in a thoughtfully curated program that educated participants and  encouraged collaboration to work towards solutions.  We are honored that our attendees wanted to see us make the Textile X Ocean Connector Sail an annual event!Both Krystle and Carolynn have served on the San Francisco Bay Microplastics Working Group for many years and are active in the ocean conservation space- continuing to find links where they can use their superpowers in connecting passionate people, providing educational opportunities, and fostering creative collaborations to support the development of a blue material world.

Sustainability and Data-First  Future to Enhance Customer  Experience,"September 21, 2023, 12:00 PM","September 21, 2023, 02:30 PM","80 Bras Basah Road, Singapore, 189560, Singapore","Strategic Imperatives: Architecting an intrinsically sustainable, data-first, and hybrid by design future  In the current era of digital transformation and sustainability, businesses worldwide are increasingly acknowledging the profound impact of adopting an edge-centric, cloud-enabled, data-driven, and AI-empowered approach. This shift in focus holds the potential to revolutionise industries and drive innovation and efficiency to unprecedented levels. Singapore's organisations stand out as leading example in embracing a sustainable digital future. These efforts are contributing to the nation's economic growth and positioning it as a dominant force in the digital age for long-term economic viability. Research shows that businesses combining sustainability and digital transformation are 2.5 times more likely to become top performers. Achieving this requires balancing sustainability and digital efforts, aligning technology, managing data effectively, driving revenue growth, enhancing efficiency, and reducing carbon footprint from edge to cloud.  According to Gartner, 86% of business leaders view sustainability as an investment that safeguards their organisation from disruption. 80% of leaders reported that sustainability optimised costs, and 83% said it created short- and long-term value for their organisations. However, the idea of solely migrating all workloads to the cloud overlooks the complexity of a multi-gen IT environment, the reality of multiple clouds, and the ever-expanding edge computing. Sustainable IT involves more than just moving workloads to the cloud. According to IDC, 70% of apps and data remain in data centres, colocations and edges, for reasons like low latency needs, data governance policies, sovereignty, compliance, or the entangled applications typical of traditional IT.  The shift towards a data-first world, characterised by its increasing data-intensive nature, AI-powered technologies, and API-driven systems, introduces complexities related to data security, privacy, and the need to balance innovation and sustainability.  Organisations must cultivate a strategic vision, foster teamwork, and demonstrate a commitment to a future where data takes precedence while upholding sustainable responsibilities. By prioritising these aspects, they can navigate these challenges effectively and drive sustainable innovation forward. Customer Experience-Driven Data Strategy:  Harnessing data to align with customer-centric goals can elevate customer satisfaction and loyalty. This strategy optimises the customer experience through personalised interactions and enhanced products and services. Large-Scale AI for Sustainable IT Pathways: Strategic optimisation of workloads and resources powered by a large-scale, renewable-energy AI infrastructure can significantly lower carbon footprints. This approach promotes long-term sustainability and contributes to the circular economy, aligning with Sinapore's Green Plan. “Hybrid by Design” Future: Competitiveness in the digital age requires sustainable evolution, which includes embracing efficient technologies, optimal cloud consumption, and principles of the circular economy. This commitment to sustainability can enhance competitiveness while contributing positively to the environment. OpenGov Asia is pleased to invite you to an exclusive OpenGov Event that aims to provide the latest information on the key factors that will recalibrate digital transformation strategies for sustainability advancement, data first and current hybrid design. This is a closed-door, invitation-only, interactive session with top tech leaders from Singapore.  The main objective of the roundtable will be to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, insights, and experiences around how to architect a future that is intrinsically sustainable, data-driven, and hybrid by design. This exploration will dive into the far-reaching impacts and implications of these elements on business operations, customer experiences, and overall organisational growth.

Or how these businesses can innovate and stay current through the ages?Singapore is home to many heritage businesses, many with decades of history in their respective trades. They may be helmed by craftspeople with unique talents in creating traditional effigies and religious products, or culinary experts passionate about preserving our food heritage. No matter the industry, each heritage business is a precious repository of cultural knowledge. However, many of these businesses find it difficult to survive in modern times, with dwindling sales, higher operating costs, and competition from newer businesses. Join us as we talk to Ng Tze Yong of Say Tian Hng, a traditional effigy workshop, and Nicholas Tan of Sweetlands Bread and Bakery, a traditional bakery. This conversation will be moderated by Chester Matthias Tan, Founder of the Heritage Business Foundation.A﻿bout the Heritage Business FoundationThe Heritage Business Foundation is a non-profit organisation dedicated to the advancement of heritage through the supporting, networking, and promoting of heritage establishments, as well as the documenting, preserving, and disseminating of heritage material for research, education, and posterity. To that end, the Foundation works directly with a wide variety of heritage businesses and artisans to help them survive and compete in the modern marketplace. By ensuring the sustainability of these businesses, the Foundation aims to ensure the protection and transmission of their cultural heritage.A﻿bout Say Tian HngSay Tian Hng is a traditional effigy workshop that bears a long, rich history – even longer than some of the artefacts present in their shop at 35 Neil Road. Over the years, Say Tian Hng has supplied countless examples of their work to the largest temples and the most modest home altars. They are a family-run business, and multiple generations of their artisans have been plying and passing down this trade since 1896. Today, Say Tian Hng is one of the last remaining Taoist effigy-carving workshops left in Singapore, and is gradually developing new plans to keep the business growing with the times.A﻿bout Sweetlands Bread and BakeryTucked away on a side street, away from the hustle and bustle of Balestier Road, is Sweetlands Bread and Bakery. Founded in 1960 as Kim Keat Bakery, Sweetlands began by supplying bread to the many coffee shops clustered in the Balestier area. Their 南洋面包 (Nanyang bread), a traditional bread loaf first popularised in coffee shops across Singapore, was and continues to be a crowd favourite. From old-school staples like rainbow bread to Western favourites like ciabatta, Sweetlands boasts a diverse range of over fifty different products which they supply to both walk-in customers and F&B businesses alike.",https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/qixi-fest-65328388883,https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/sustaining-heritage-businesses-say-tian-hng-sweetlands-bakery-13-aug-tickets-681522250397,Singapore
