An ‚ÄòUrban Climate Walk‚Äô Special Interest Group Event; City of London,"August 05, 2023, 01:00 PM","August 05, 2023, 03:30 PM","39 Finsbury Square, London, EC2A, United Kingdom","Please join us for our 6th annual Special Interest Group Urban Climate Walking tour through the City of London where we will be joined by Jane Findlay and Rosie Whicheloe, two leading experts in the field of Biodiversity net gain and Green Infrastructure. This event serves as a platform to discuss both the challenges and opportunities of creating good quality public realm and why it matters. Established in 2014, the urban climate walking tour was developed as an instructional technique for linking together diverse aspects of urban sustainability. The tour leads us through a series of urban streets and public spaces, where we explore some of the consequences of building and urban design decisions on the background climate, access to passive resources and health and wellbeing. Moreover, the tour provides an opportunity to discuss the quality of these spaces in terms of their influences on nature-based solutions and their contribution to clean and comfortable air. By physically experiencing the interdependent relationships between climate, geography, biodiversity, and green infrastructure, we gain valuable insights into how the design of cities influence access to natural resources. These include day and sunlight, ventilation, air quality, and their subsequent impacts on biodiversity and health and wellbeing. Join us on this enlightening journey as we deepen our understanding of the complex connections between urban elements and their implications for a sustainable and thriving urban environment.The walk takes between 2 and 3 hours giving plenty of time for discussion; the walk can be done under all weather conditions‚Ä¶ In fact, the harsher the conditions the more dramatic the walk ‚Ä¶. Sensible clothing and footwear are essential!Meeting point ‚ù∂ The Martha Smith Memorial Water Fountain - 39 Finsbury Square, London, England, EC2AFinishing Point ‚ùæ The Thames Path London BridgeThe Urban Climate Walking Tours include the City of London, Temple, and the Paddington Basin (Central London); Birmingham (UK); Sao Paulo (Brasil); Borl√§nge (Sweden); Paris (France); with new walks planned for Tottenham (North London); Ipswich (Suffolk) and Barcelona (Spain).***** Dr Julie Futcher (curator); is a chartered architect from professional practice; with significant experience in both research and research-led teaching. Her research explores the direct, indirect, and dynamic influence of urban morphology in regulating the energy exchanges that characterise densely built urban landscapes. Importantly this includes the influence of built form on access to passive resources (i.e., day and sunlight and street scale ventilation), air quality and in turn, the physical outcomes on the neighbouring setting. Her research interest lies in drawing attention to many of the interdependent net-energy outcomes which currently fall outside the broader discussion on sustainable development. She is currently developing an interdisciplinary planning framework that integrates existing urban knowledge at a fundamental level.Jane Findlay; is a Landscape Architect, the Immediate Past President of the Landscape Institute, and the founding director of Fira. She is a masterplanner and designer with over 38 years‚Äô experience of designing and delivering large and complex projects. Jane is particularly experienced in the design of the healing landscape for healthcare having worked on some of the largest and most complex healthcare projects in the UK.Jane is passionate about the psychological and physical benefits that quality landscape design and nature play in all aspects of the public realm. She is a pioneering exponent of evidence-based design and ‚Äògreen place-making‚Äô, the importance of health and wellbeing in the way that people experience our urban environment and the spaces we create within, around, and connecting places. Her interest in multifunctional green infrastructure is reflected in her design work. Whether it is creating new settlements, transportation systems, places to work and learn, or campus design, her philosophy is to lead with the green to create places that address climate change, that are climate resilient, biodiverse and are healthy.Rosie Whicheloe; is a Landscape Ecologist with a specialism in Urban ecology, Ecological Networks and Green Infrastructure. She is currently working for the London Borough of Sutton as a Biodiversity Net Gain Officer. In the last eight years she has played a key role in a number of industry leading research and design guidance including: Berkeley Homes - Nine Concepts - Designing for Nature and Beauty (2020), the Greater London Authority Green Space Factor Research (2019) and Urban Greening for BIodiversity Net Gain - a Design Guide (2021), and the first Local Nature Recovery Strategy in Hackney (2021).

"Transport, Climate, Action!","September 30, 2023, 10:00 AM","September 30, 2023, 05:00 PM","Regents Wharf 8 All Saints Street, London, N1 9RL, United Kingdom","After our successful first ever grassroots conference last year in Birmingham, we thought there was such a good energy and vibe that we ought to hold another one. Our aim is to give local transport, climate and countryside and nature campaigners an opportunity to share ideas and inspiration. We want to celebrate our successes and work out what we need to focus on over the next 12 months or so before a General Election and in the face of some extraordinary backlashes to taking action on health and climate grounds.AÔªølso, this year marks some notable anniversaries, it being the 30th anniversary of the first ever national anti-roads conference and major protests at Twyford Down, while it is the 60th anniversary of the infamous Beeching report. To mark the occasion Emma Must, a prominent campaigner from the 1990s and ALARM UK days has agreed to read some of her poetry about the anti-roads movement.WÔªøe've got some great speakers and contributors:Jonathan Bray - ex-director, Urban Transport GroupRoxanne de Beaux - Executive Director, Camcycle (part of Cambridge Sustainable Travel Alliance)Isabelle Clement MBE - CEO, Wheels for WellbeingCÔªølaire Haigh - founder & CEO of Greener VisionRoger Harrabin - former BBC environment correspondentLisa Hopkinson - associate of Transport for Quality of LifeProfessor Glenn Lyons - Professor of Future Mobility, UWE BristolDavid Milner - Deputy Director, Create StreetsStefan Rollnick - Head of The Misinformation Cell, Lynn GlobalWe've gone for London to make it easier for those from the East and South East who  found it difficult getting to Birmingham last year. The venue is close to Kings Cross and Euston so is still easy to get to from the North and the Midlands. We aim to put the spotlight on the existential threat to public transport and active travel as the Government cuts funding in order to allow it to build more roads. This is while the potholes on local roads get ever bigger. At the same time The Government has ordered Network Rail not to replace worn out infrastructure, creating a short term saving but costing more in the long term. The Government's obsession with making things worse is seen by its determined inaction on cutting carbon quickly enough as it now admits it won't meet its international target to cut emissions by 68% by 2030.WÔªøe also want to run some sessions to give campaigners the understanding and skills to deal with some of the disingenuous and toxic messaging that is being used against cutting traffic.TÔªøAN 2022 conference in BirminghamWe will have two sets of workshops, covering a variety of topics as follows, so there should be something for everyone: Lessons from Welsh Roads Review &  road policy changes in EnglandWhere to next for buses?The future of railActive travel - achieving the 2030 targetAir pollution: What next for Clean Air Zones and more?Nature / biodiversity / roadkillHow can we get planning to step off the road to nowhere?Campaign messaging - mythbusting and reclaiming the narrativeMedia training - how to write a press release, appear on radio / TV The event will provide the perfect opportunity for networking and meeting people you mostly only ever see on a screen. We hope it will cement friendships and empower the large number of people who have been campaigning at a grassroots level over the past few years.If you would like to reclaim your entrance ticket and rail fare we do have a small amount to pay for bursaries.

Large asset owners (such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, etc.), with their longer investment horizon and their understanding of escalating socio-economic pressures, are now undergoing (and forcing) a significant reprioritisation of capital and a radical transformation of the financial system itself in a race against systemic breakdowns. This systems reboot will turn into a crisis for some and an opportunity of a lifetime for others in the real estate sector, a sector responsible for around 40% of global GHG emissions (in constructing and operating buildings around the world).Manuel Magalhaes is an advisor to governments, global corporations and large asset owners on cross-sectoral interventions and capital allocations towards a more inclusive and resilient climate transition.

Want to dive deeper into building a vision for transformative climate reparations? Want to see that collective vision turned into a piece of artwork for an upcoming exhibition on the topic? Join us for a workshop in London on Saturday 26th August. This interactive workshop will reflect on  the history of the colonial debt crisis, what it means for our wider movements, and how we can work together to support each other‚Äôs campaigns. We will explore the concept of climate reparations and how debt justice can be part of a broader agenda to repair the harm faced by communities around the world. As part of the workshop, we‚Äôll be co-creating an artistic response to the topic to be displayed at an exhibition on debt, colonialism, and the climate crisis at Peckham Levels in November 2023. If you don‚Äôt consider yourself an artist, don‚Äôt worry - we still want you to come along and input into our shared vision for change. Right now, 54 countries are in debt crisis, with the need to make repayments stopping them from investing in healthcare, education, and responding to the climate crisis. This is not an accident. For centuries, powerful governments, institutions and corporations have used debt to control and plunder the resources of countries in the global south for their own gain. At the same time, countries and communities in the global south are disproportionately facing the impacts of the climate crisis.From colonial powers forcing countries into debt at the point of independence, to allowing corporations like BlackRock to continue to make huge profits from debt repayments today, we can‚Äôt build new visions of reparative justice without understanding the roots of the crisis we face.When: Saturday 26th August 2023, 2pm-5pm.Where: Dance Hall, Waterloo Action Centre, SE1 7AAAccess information: Wheelchair access, accessible toilets.

The films engage with the current climate crisis, commenting on our collective relationship to water and why we should be protecting it.

The films mix storytelling, conceptual movement, first-hand experiences and our own research/observations.The Water Series workshop is part of Staffordshire St's Festival of Community, co-curated with Peckham Platform and F.A.T Studio.

We need to imagine it in some detail so as to be able to think about it clearly and constructively, and to explore some complex feelings and thoughts which may often be taboo and hard to talk about.With sturdy enough support structures in place, most people can sustain challenging feelings without either dissociating and numbing or going into blind panic. They can engage with difficult truths whilst staying connected and grounded.A climate caf√© aims to be such a structure - a container that is strong enough to allow the exploration of fear, anxiety, and other emotions such as anger, helplessness, sadness, grief or depression.The focus of discussion is participants‚Äô thoughts and feelings about the climate and ecological crisis. There are no guest speakers and no talks, and it is an advice-free zone.

Devil‚Äôs Botany London Absinthe is an exquisite aperitif reminiscent of a British meadow. Distilled with a bouquet of the finest botanicals, Absinthe‚Äôs historic trinity of grand wormwood, green anise and fennel seed is expertly blended with local botanicals such as elderflower, lemon balm and meadowsweet that can be found growing wild across London.During this workshop, guests will be able to choose from a large variety of pressed flowers to be arranged on quality A4 paper during. All the necessary equipment will be provided.  Everyone walks out with their creation in a pretty envelope afterwards.Event suitable for 18+ years and older only. Maddy‚Äôs Workshop is a local East London based decor brand created by french artisan Manon Le Fer. All flowers are sourced sustainably from temperate climates. The pressing process allows us to keep and sell them all year round until the next bloom. Just like humans, every flower is unique. Thus, Maddy's Workshop tries to reveal the beauty in each of them.https://maddysworkshop.com/+Devil‚Äôs Botany is London‚Äôs first Absinthe distillery, celebrating the forgotten elixirs of London's curious past. Launched in January 2021, their original recipes call upon the traditions once mastered by the apothecaries of 18th Century London, the vast herbarium of flavours they housed and the botanical elixirs concocted. Hidden within their recipe books was a key to the origins of absinthe that had previously remained unknown. Nearly a century before the first commercial distilleries opened elsewhere in the world, London‚Äôs dram-drinkers were already enjoying a precursor to the botanical spirit made by the local apothecaries. Delightfully bittersweet and clear in colour, the noble aperitif has been praised for its revitalising flavour and found most effective in raising the spirits for over 300 years.https://www.devilsbotany.com/",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/the-last-tuesday-society-viktor-wynd-museum-33776720489,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/pressed-flower-workshop-wildflower-spritz-with-devils-botany-tickets-649628184387,London

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive [CSRD] has to be incorporated into member state law by 2024, and with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards [ESRS] being adopted in June this year, businesses are scrambling. They need to prepare existing systems and processes or overhaul them completely to produce consistent, comparable, and quality data that is compliant with the regulation. And they need to do this at speed. A lack of clarity as to how the upcoming regulation will impact businesses and what they will be legally obliged to disclose, combined with differing global collection standards and capabilities has meant many are already behind in their preparation for the CSRD. The pressure is building as the risk of not being CSRD compliant increases. On top of this, business must match stakeholder requirements to provide material information that stands up to scrutiny and presented in a coherent, engaging format.At Sustainability Reporting Europe 2023, a part of IMPACT Congress London, we will help you understand how  to utilise systems and processes to provide consistent, comparable, and reliable data in an automated fashion, explore how sustainability can work closer and more effectively together with finance, risk, and legal teams, and how businesses can meet regulatory requirements while not losing sight of the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô we report.FÔªøor more event information, visit the official website here: https://events.reutersevents.com/sustainable-business/reporting-europe?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_campaign=5912",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/reuters-events-65905943663,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reuters-events-sustainability-reporting-europe-2023-tickets-636464230647,London

Old Oak West is one of the largest regenerations schemes in the country, redeveloping industrial and railways land around the new High Speed 2 station at Old Oak Common. The Strategic Development and Infrastructure Team (SD&I) at Homes England have been working closely with the Old Oak and Park Royal Development Corporation, OPDC to prepare the five case Green Book business case for Old Oak West; acting as the lead client coordinating inputs from an array of supporting consultants and brokering relations between different public sector partners. 
The SD&I team have also, for the past three years run a mentoring programme with Oxford Brookes University Architecture School. This year we asked the students to come up with an intervention at Old Oak West that addresses one of OPDC‚Äôs golden threads while also contributing to site-wide sustainability and social value.
The students have been given free rein to interpret the brief and have come up with a variety of interventions that respond to the site and their take on addressing sustainability.
The students will be presenting their work to Homes England and OPDC on Monday 31st July in Windsor House, so come along and see what they have been up to. The session will be presented on Teams for anybody who would like to dial in.
Please use the link below to register your interest.

The OPDC golden threads are:
A local life: A place that grew for London‚Äôs workers, now set to meet the challenge of the housing crisis and workplace evolution.
Jobs for the future: A place renowned for ingenuity in manufacture and food, now primed for future big-bang industries to solve the world‚Äôs big challenges.
The middle of everywhere: A place shaped by historic innovations in infrastructure, now in a pivotal location to connect to the world, nation, city and neighbours.
A green space that keeps growing: A place where nature has quietly flourished now being opened up to enjoy. We‚Äôre setting ambitious goals for a healthy, sustainable future.

Through a residency program, exhibitions and campaigns in the Kunsthalle Rostock as well as in the Botanical Garden Rostock, a dynamic and experimental platform was created and presented in 2022. Artists and scientists initiated an exchange of research, experiences and ambitions in the form of exhibitions and discussions. The aim now bringing the exhibition to Troy House Art Foundation London in a new version. Today, more and more people around the globe are directly impacted by climate change. Due to this, the perception of this topic has increased and it determines current discourses in many areas of life. As the basis for all its programmes, Troy House Art Foundation is initiating exhibitions, artists‚Äô residencies and exchanges, performances, conversations, educational programmes, and other public and community events. What they hold in common is their identification of art with social, ethical and scientific concerns, and their use of historic buildings, sites, and special natural settings, as integral elements for the production and display of contemporary art.The exhibition On Water & Plants - Artistic Positions on Sustainability, presents  24 artists from different countries and generations in dialogue: Eva & Adele, Germany / Francisco de Almeida, Brazil / Caetano Dias, Brazil / Jaider Esbell, Brazil / JoseÃÅ Gomes, Brazil / Rhys Himsworth, England/Germany / Sandra VaÃÅsquez de la Horra, Chile/Germany / Ingar Krauss, Germany / Alejandro Lloret, Cuba/Brazil / Paulo Neves, Brazil / Luiz Moreira, Brazil / Giacomo Orth, Germany / Jina Park, South Korea/Germany / Veronika Pfaffinger, Germany / Luzia Simons, Brazil/Germany / Vivan Sundaram, India /Armarinhos Teixeira, Brazil / Tomoyuki Ueno, Japan/Germany / Kiyomi + Tetsuhiro Uozumi, Japan/Germany /Bruno Vilela, Brazil /Thomas Wrede, Germany The show guides the visitors with current artistic confrontations related to nature in the form of installations, objects, paintings, sculptures, photographs and site-specific works focused on five topics ‚Äì On The Fascination of Nature, In Symbiosis with Nature, Analysis of Nature, Exploration of Nature and The Perception of Nature. Human-induced climate change plays a greater role and impacts not only in the countryside but also in urban habitats. Scientists and artists currently accompany this scenario and the associated future global demands on humanity, as well as the development of adaptation and solution strategies and will continue to do so in the future. The perception of nature alone is not sufficient but is crucial for changing the way we interact with it. What would be effective is a transformative change in the way society thinks and acts. The future depends on a functioning eco-humanism in interaction with different sustainability-oriented world views.  On Water & Plants - Artistic Positions on Sustainability is one more step in this journey.[1] Luzia Simons: Stockage 118, 2011. Courtesy of the artist.

‚Äì A unified ESG Scoring and measurement framework for stakeholder capitalism that FinTech can comply with, measure and be regulated to delivery capacity.
Background
FinTech SMEs find it challenging to identify methods that best suit them to bridge the gap between unsustainable and sustainable practices. Various ESG frameworks target various industry sectors, but SMEs find it challenging to identify a framework method that best suits them, as they seek to comply with emerging United Kingdom regulations. Led by the WCIT Financial Services Technology Panel, a group of industry experts on ESG, Risk and Sustainability, and post-graduate MSc students of the City, University of London conducted a comparative study of various ESG frameworks, coming up with suggestions for a unified ESG scoring and measuring framework for stakeholder capitalism that can be measured and regulated to deliver capability for FinTech SMEs. The Speakers will present the findings from the study and the recommendations of practical frameworks that assist in the development of business capability in meeting ESG targets and how using the Social Value Capability Improvement Model developed by the WCIT can assist in terms of the recommended frameworks and in terms of its ability to deliver guidance on evaluating an organisation's progress against its own ESG agenda.

Net Zero Nations Projects Conference,"November 15, 2023, 08:30 AM","November 15, 2023, 04:00 PM","1 Great George Street Westminster, London, SW1P 3AA, United Kingdom","We are at a crossroads in our historyAs we recover from the impact of the pandemic on our lives and livelihoods, we know that it will not be enough to go back to the way things were before.The science is clear, we know that human activity is changing our climate and that this will have a devastating impact on human lives, the economy, and the natural world ‚Äì ranging from the extinction of some species and the melting of ice caps to extreme weather patterns threatening our homes, businesses, and communities. Energy security and net zero are two sides of the same coin. The energy transition and net zero are among the greatest opportunities facing this country and we are committed to ensuring that the UK takes advantage of its early mover status. Global action to mitigate climate change is essential to long term prosperity ‚Äì the overall costs and risks of global warming to be equivalent to losing between 5% and 20% of global GDP each year.After decades of reliance on imported fossil fuels, the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero‚Äôs mission is to replace them with cheaper, cleaner, domestic sources of energy. In response to high household energy bills resulting from Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, the government stepped in, paying around half of the average household‚Äôs energy bills over winter and around half of wholesale energy costs for some businesses. But the way to maintain lower cost energy for everyone is to move to cleaner and cheaper energy to protect us from volatile international energy markets, while underpinning our clean energy transition, so the UK becomes a net zero economy by 2050. It will also help us make sure Britain has among the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe by 2035. The UK has already made huge progress in decarbonising its economy and decoupling emissions from economic growth. Thanks to the Climate Change Act (2008) and Environment Act (2021), we have a strong legal framework for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Between 1990 and 2021, we have cut our emissions by 48%, decarbonising faster than any other G7 country, whilst growing the economy by 65%. The UK was also the first G7 country to sign net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 into law. The UK‚Äôs strategy for net-zero is to lead the world in ending our contribution to climate change while turning this mission into the greatest opportunity for jobs and prosperity for our country since the industrial revolution.Removing dirty fossil fuels from the global economy will lead to the creation of vast new global industries from offshore wind to electric vehicles and carbon capture and storage. By moving first and making the United Kingdom the birthplace of the Green Industrial Revolution we are building a defining competitive edge. The changes will have wider benefits for the public and businesses alike. We will all enjoy cleaner air, increased biodiversity and improved access to green spaces. We will see greater efficiency in the way we travel and heat our buildings, which will be better protected from more extreme weather events. We will also put consumers at the heart of this transition, helping them make their homes warmer, and more efficient, and ensure that they pay a fair, affordable price for their energy.In 2050, we will still be driving cars, flying planes and heating our homes, but our cars will be electric gliding silently around our cities, our planes will be zero-emission allowing us to fly guilt-free, and our homes will be heated by cheap reliable power drawn from the winds of the North Sea. And everywhere you look, in every part of our United Kingdom, there will be jobs. Good jobs, green jobs, well-paid jobs, levelling up our country while squashing down our carbon emissions. That is the clean and prosperous future that awaits every one of us as the UK leads the world in the race to net zero. But we cannot tackle climate change alone. We will need to take a coordinated approach, working across local and national government, the devolved administrations, and with businesses and civil society organisations. And we will need to make it easier and fairer for individuals, businesses and households to decarbonise so that our whole society can work together to reduce emissions. Don‚Äôt miss this fantastic opportunity to attend the conference and hear from those leading on the net-zero agenda by highlighting key examples of case studies and projects from around the world using new innovations and technologies which can help accelerate the transition to a net-zero nation by 2050.Join us on the 15th of Novembner 2023 for the Net Zero Nations Projects Conference.Get Involved, We All Have A Part to Play‚Ä¶..Find Yours!",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/evolutional-events-44657800583,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/net-zero-nations-projects-conference-registration-670628737607,London

On the way, we discover the corporate greenwashing that started the recycling movement; the dark truth behind our second-hand donations; and come face to face with the 10,000-year legacy of our nuclear waste. Both shocking and hopeful, Wasteland is the timely and ultimately human story at the heart of an urgent global issue.ABOUT THE AUTHOROliver Franklin-Wallis is an award-winning magazine journalist, whose writing has appeared in GQ, WIRED, The Guardian, the New York Times, The Times Magazine, The Sunday Times Magazine, The Economist's 1843 magazine, and many other publications.

Peace in the Park -  Forest Bathing & Nature Spirit,"July 29, 2023, 09:30 AM","July 29, 2023, 11:30 AM","Coombe Road, Croydon, CR0 5RQ, United Kingdom"," Peace in the Park - Forest Bathing / Shinrin Yoku - nature spiritStart your weekend with peace.When we go walking with others we walk and talk, not noticing the trees and plants around us, the natural environment is usually literally scenery. Our minds are engaged with stories and chatter.At Peace in the Park, we are free from this to reconnect with nature, at a level and as deep as we want to experience. In a group setting the energy of this experience can feel amplified as we witness each others journey.A  Peace in the Park session is forest bathing and beyond. An intuitive and unique mix of healing, nature spirit, personal development and forest bathing. In the space created, we rediscover our inner peace, relaxation and well-being.Small groups of not more than eight for a more profound experience.There is a silence into which the world cannot intrude. There is an ancient peace you carry in your heart and have not lost.I invite you to step aside, let go and share a quiet time of listening and being, amongst the trees and the natural environment.I hold a space for you, inviting you to immerse yourself in our natural environment, guiding you intuitively. A space where tree hugging is a normal healing activity.The natural environment meets us where we are, we are free to be ourselves, to let go and immerse ourselves in the peace and love of nature. We can experience the healing that we need.Each session stands alone as a unique experience that opens within the presence of the trees and the plant world.Forest therapy isn't just a walk in the woods. We actively immerse in the natural environment, taking in the shapes, smells and sounds.Deep and profound healing changes can be experienced as we enhance our reconnection to the natural environment.#Coombe Woods is a woodland that I have been coming to for over twenty years, as my local woodland. We journey through the beautiful areas, greeting the Sacred Cedar and other trees of the Scots pine, experiencing its sweet resin, the birch, sweet chestnut, oak and beech.The session is intended to be a safe space consisting of a variety of invitations, which may includeA sensory experience, journeying through our senses within the healing, natural environment.

Our aim is to give local transport, climate and countryside and nature campaigners an opportunity to share ideas and inspiration. We want to celebrate our successes and work out what we need to focus on over the next 12 months or so before a General Election and in the face of some extraordinary backlashes to taking action on health and climate grounds.AÔªølso, this year marks some notable anniversaries, it being the 30th anniversary of the first ever national anti-roads conference and major protests at Twyford Down, while it is the 60th anniversary of the infamous Beeching report. To mark the occasion Emma Must, a prominent campaigner from the 1990s and ALARM UK days has agreed to read some of her poetry about the anti-roads movement.WÔªøe've got some great speakers and contributors:Jonathan Bray - ex-director, Urban Transport GroupRoxanne de Beaux - Executive Director, Camcycle (part of Cambridge Sustainable Travel Alliance)Isabelle Clement MBE - CEO, Wheels for WellbeingCÔªølaire Haigh - founder & CEO of Greener VisionRoger Harrabin - former BBC environment correspondentLisa Hopkinson - associate of Transport for Quality of LifeProfessor Glenn Lyons - Professor of Future Mobility, UWE BristolDavid Milner - Deputy Director, Create StreetsStefan Rollnick - Head of The Misinformation Cell, Lynn GlobalWe've gone for London to make it easier for those from the East and South East who  found it difficult getting to Birmingham last year. The venue is close to Kings Cross and Euston so is still easy to get to from the North and the Midlands. We aim to put the spotlight on the existential threat to public transport and active travel as the Government cuts funding in order to allow it to build more roads. This is while the potholes on local roads get ever bigger. At the same time The Government has ordered Network Rail not to replace worn out infrastructure, creating a short term saving but costing more in the long term. The Government's obsession with making things worse is seen by its determined inaction on cutting carbon quickly enough as it now admits it won't meet its international target to cut emissions by 68% by 2030.WÔªøe also want to run some sessions to give campaigners the understanding and skills to deal with some of the disingenuous and toxic messaging that is being used against cutting traffic.TÔªøAN 2022 conference in BirminghamWe will have two sets of workshops, covering a variety of topics as follows, so there should be something for everyone: Lessons from Welsh Roads Review &  road policy changes in EnglandWhere to next for buses?The future of railActive travel - achieving the 2030 targetAir pollution: What next for Clean Air Zones and more?Nature / biodiversity / roadkillHow can we get planning to step off the road to nowhere?Campaign messaging - mythbusting and reclaiming the narrativeMedia training - how to write a press release, appear on radio / TV The event will provide the perfect opportunity for networking and meeting people you mostly only ever see on a screen. We hope it will cement friendships and empower the large number of people who have been campaigning at a grassroots level over the past few years.If you would like to reclaim your entrance ticket and rail fare we do have a small amount to pay for bursaries. Information about this will be in your confirmation email.PÔªølenty of opportunities for networking and making friends",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/transport-action-network-27452111981,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/transport-climate-action-tickets-600836115997,London

Into The Woods - Ellie Davies,"July 27, 2023, 10:00 AM","July 27, 2023, 06:00 PM","178 Brompton Road, London, SW3 1HQ, United Kingdom","In Ellie Davies' body of work, the forest, this impressive natural environment, is her studio. Davies grew up in the New Forest, and spent her childhood exploring and playing in the woods with her sister. Now, as an artist, she uses photography to examine her relationship with that natural environment, and try to reconnect with the wild landscapes of her youth. Ultimately, can those remembered and imagined places be recaptured?In her new series, ""Chalk Streams"", Davies showcases the importance of one of the world's rarest ecosystems: the chalk stream. Under threat from manmade and environmental stressors, the chalk stream provides a setting for a high biodiversity of plants and creatures, and rival rainforests and coral reefs in their ecological importance. As 85% of chalk streams are found across the UK, it was a natural progression for Davies' body of work. The forest, as a symbol in folklore and human psychology, is richly tapestried within human experience and literature. It is against, and within, this verdant background that Davies explore the natural landscape, and creates a sort of limbo zone between reality and fantasy. The temporary interventions she creates in the forest demonstrate her profound respect and love for this immense biosphere.TÔªøhe show will coincide with the publication of Ellie Davies' monograph.

Towards a more child-friendly London: the people making it happen,"November 27, 2023, 09:20 AM","November 27, 2023, 04:30 PM","26 Store Street, London, WC1E 7BT, United Kingdom","A conference hosted by the Built Environment Trust, together with author and researcher Tim Gill. 

This conference is for people that are interested in and passionate about the built environment and children‚Äôs health, wellbeing and development. You do not have to be from a built environment background, and you do not have to be an expert in child development. 
We know that the built environment plays a big role in how we feel about where we live, study and play. However, children‚Äôs needs and wishes are often overshadowed by those of adults. How do we get decision-makers to care about children? How do we support marginalised groups, and those whose voices are not yet being heard? What lessons can we learn from projects in London and elsewhere? And what are we willing to do to ensure that future generations of Londoners feel at home in their city? 

The day will offer insights and candid conversations from those at the forefront of making London‚Äôs neighbourhoods more child-friendly. Our lively panels include residents, designers, developers, and campaigners who are all making a difference. Each panel will be chaired by an expert who will also open up the discussion to all participants.  

During the breaks, attendees will have the opportunity to add to the discussion using our giant comments wall, and to experience different versions of the same street using a VR resource developed by Arup.

Please note that this is a free event and lunch is not provided.

‚Äì A unified ESG Scoring and measurement framework for stakeholder capitalism that FinTech can comply with, measure and be regulated to delivery capacity.
Background
FinTech SMEs find it challenging to identify methods that best suit them to bridge the gap between unsustainable and sustainable practices. Various ESG frameworks target various industry sectors, but SMEs find it challenging to identify a framework method that best suits them, as they seek to comply with emerging United Kingdom regulations. Led by the WCIT Financial Services Technology Panel, a group of industry experts on ESG, Risk and Sustainability, and post-graduate MSc students of the City, University of London conducted a comparative study of various ESG frameworks, coming up with suggestions for a unified ESG scoring and measuring framework for stakeholder capitalism that can be measured and regulated to deliver capability for FinTech SMEs. The Speakers will present the findings from the study and the recommendations of practical frameworks that assist in the development of business capability in meeting ESG targets and how using the Social Value Capability Improvement Model developed by the WCIT can assist in terms of the recommended frameworks and in terms of its ability to deliver guidance on evaluating an organisation's progress against its own ESG agenda.

Dr. Marty Bradley, Sustainable Aviation Consultant and Educator, mkbradle@usc.edu. Dr. Bradley is a AIAA Fellow with 39 years of aerospace experience and is now a consultant and educator focused on sustainable aviation. He is an Adjunct Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Practice at USC and teaches AIAA short courses in Sustainable Aviation and Electric Aircraft.
Geoengineering, using technology to counter the effects of climate change, is a controversial topic. Some think the idea is counterproductive, as it diverts attention and resources away from reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Others feel it may be the only way to mitigate runaway climate change and buy enough time to truly convert to low carbon energy sources. Should we be studying how to use high altitude systems for observation or to alter atmospheric chemistry, or deploying reflector or scattering objects with space systems, or other possible solutions in geoengineering applications?
Some recent research studies recommend that we should be researching aviation enabled geoengineering applications, despite the high current levels of uncertainty:

Geoengineering, using technology to counter the effects of climate change, is a controversial topic. Some think the idea is counterproductive, as it diverts attention and resources away from reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Others feel it may be the only way to mitigate runaway climate change and buy enough time to truly convert to low carbon energy sources. Should we be studying how to use high altitude systems for observation or to alter atmospheric chemistry, or deploying reflector or scattering objects with space systems, or other possible solutions in geoengineering applications?
Some recent research studies recommend that we should be researching aviation enabled geoengineering applications, despite the high current levels of uncertainty:

About A DARKER WILDERNESS:A vibrant collection of personal and lyric essays in conversation with archival objects of Black history and memory.What are the politics of nature? Who owns it, where is it, what role does it play in our lives? Does it need to be tamed? Are we ourselves natural? In A Darker Wilderness, a constellation of luminary writers reflect on the significance of nature in their lived experience and on the role of nature in the lives of Black folks in the United States. Each of these essays engages with a single archival object, whether directly or obliquely, exploring stories spanning hundreds of years and thousands of miles, traveling from roots to space and finding rich Blackness everywhere.Erin Sharkey considers Benjamin Banneker‚Äôs 1795 almanac, as she follows the passing of seasons in an urban garden in Buffalo. Naima Penniman reflects on a statue of Haitian revolutionary Fran√ßois Makandal, within her own pursuit of environmental justice.

A Vagrant, there was Katie Beaton of the Cape Breton Beaton, specifically Mabou, a tight-knit seaside community where the lobster is as abundant as beaches, fiddles, and Gaelic folk songs.

Katie encounters the harsh reality of life in the oil sands, where trauma is an everyday occurrence yet is never discussed.Beaton‚Äôs natural cartooning prowess is on full display as she draws colossal machinery and mammoth vehicles set against a sublime Albertan backdrop of wildlife, northern lights, and boreal forest.

We share many goals, like addressing climate change and public health crises, not to mention reducing the likelihood of nuclear confrontation. Despite these deeply shared self-interests, the relationship between the two countries has grown increasingly tense.Congress established a committee to boost competition with China. A Chinese balloon entered US airspace, and the US shot it down. Nancy Pelosi took a controversial trip to Taiwan, and China retaliated with military exercises. These events and others have led many to be deeply concerned that a new Cold War - or worse - is on its way.   Join Chicago Area Peace Action, the Quincy Institute, and CODEPINK for a discussion about what‚Äôs going on between China and the United States, and how communities like ours can work to encourage diplomacy and cooperative engagement - and to avoid the horrors of war. Panelists: Jake Werner, Quincy Institute: Jake Werner is a Research Fellow at the Quincy Institute. He researches the emergence of great power conflict between the US and China and develops policies to rebuild constructive economic relations.Jodie Evans, CODEPINK: Jodie is co-founder of CODEPINK and founded the campaign China Is Not Our Enemy.

Knowing how to effectively raise your voice for change is key to opening new opportunities for you to create impact as a leader. Change-making opportunities don‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äòfind you.‚Äô They demand vision, bravery, and an effective brand strategy.¬†Brand communication, or personal branding, is basically about psychology. With a brand image, you create a distinctive, unique association with your target audience. It‚Äôs your unique ideas; your values; what you bring to the world; and how you can help your audience, all tied up in how you present yourself. Pioneers and thought leaders, working for themselves or within organizations, who take a stand on important societal or environmental issues can be the catalyst for the change the world‚Äôs needs. With this bootcamp, you can find your voice, raise your visibility and join the growing movement toward business as a force for good! ¬†Collaboration for a better worldAll meaningful change begins with knowing yourself. The way you are comfortable working. Your strengths and weaknesses. What you really enjoy and what you fear. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your emotions, values, beliefs, behaviors, passions, purpose, etc. It shouldn‚Äôt surprise you, then, that becoming self-aware is the first step for effective personal branding too.That is why we, as The School of Life, are incredibly excited to host the Humblebrag and offer their course Positioning for Purpose as part as our training programs for professionals.

Libraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment,"August 19, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 19, 2023, 06:00 PM","1000 Burgemeester Brokxlaan, 5041 SG Tilburg, Netherlands","The IFLA Environment, Sustainability and Libraries Section (ENSULIB) together with the Public Libraries Section (PLS) in collaboration with Bibliotheek Midden-Brabant, LocHal are organising a satellite conference prior to the IFLA World Library and Information Congress 2023 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The focus will be on ‚ÄúLibraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment‚Äù. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans. With a mix of keynotes, lightning talks and workshops, it will be an interactive, engaging and inspiring day. Programme9.00 ‚Äì Registration & Coffee9.30 ‚Äì  Keynote:  Ton van Vlimmeren (Netherlands) ‚Äì Libraries Building Sustainable CommunitiesTon van Vlimmeren is the President of the European Library Organization (EBLIDA), member of the Standing Committee of the Metropolitan Libraries Section of IFLA and one of the founders of Public Libraries 2030. This keynote will highlight how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help libraries on their journey towards a sustainable, inclusive, and democratic society10.20 ‚Äì Lightning Talks: STRATEGIES & CHALLENGES: IMPLEMENTING SDGS IN LIBRARIESMinna M√§nnikk√∂ (Finland) ‚Äì Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap: Climate Action in Oulu, Finland In 2020, Oulu City Library implemented a Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap. Based on the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap defines key development areas and sets out implementation plans. It focuses on promoting environmental awareness, reducing environmental impact and responsible construction, with the aim that sustainable development permeates all areas of the library‚Äôs daily work. This presentation will outline the roadmap and how it is being used as a long-term tool for climate action in Oulu City Library in Finland.Sarah Tribelhorn (USA) ‚Äì Bringing the SDGs Alive in an Academic LibraryThe San Diego State University Library has mapped its work to the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of employee roles, projects, and the library website. The process culminated in an exhibition that led to an engaging community discussion and challenged students, staff, and faculty to think critically about how they can contribute to these goals. This presentation will describe the process as a catalyst for community engagement, partnerships, and empowerment around climate awareness and the SDGs.Nathalice Bezerra Cardoso (Brazil) ‚Äì Challenges of the SDGs: Case Study of the German LibrariesThe SDGs have gained prominence in recent years, and there has been increased discussion on the role and social responsibilities of libraries regarding this issue. This presentation will provide an understanding of how German libraries are contributing to the SDGs. Do the people who are working in the libraries know what the SDGs are about?? Which SDGs are addressed by German public libraries? What services and actions are being developed in German libraries to achieve the SDGs?11.00 ‚Äì  Coffee Break 11.30 ‚Äì Workshops Workshop 1: Beth Filar Williams (USA) ‚Äì Inner Development Goals: A Collaborative Exploration WorkshopThe Inner Development Goals (IDGs) are a framework for accelerating our work towards the SDGs, co-created by diverse, international experts in response to current crises. The IDGs can help us access the deep level beneath the structures so that we can work on ourselves and how we relate to others, care for the world and create change. Participants will be invited to explore this framework in small groups ‚Äì shifting awareness, connecting with each other and the earth. Workshop 2: Liselotte Dessauvagie (Netherlands) ‚Äì SDGs Bookclub: For a Better Future!An SDGs Bookclub is an annotated list of selected books that teachers and librarians can use to discuss and explore the SDGs with children (and adults). Suggestions for teaching will accompany the book selection. In this workshop, the Dutch version of the SDGs Bookclub will be presented and the selection will be discussed. Participants will work on a small SDGs Bookclub during the session and explore how the SDGs can help build a better future for all through books.Workshop 3: Daniel Hackborn (Canada) ‚Äì MACK Framework: Situating Climate Action in Local Library ContextsWhile anthropogenic global warming is inherently a global issue demanding systemic action, developing responses at a local institutional level can be overwhelming. In this workshop, we will introduce the Mitigation-Adaptation-Community-Knowledge (MACK) conceptual model and, using Amiskwaciw√¢skahikan (Edmonton), Canada as a guiding case study, illustrate how this model can be applied to other local libraries in order to clarify and analyse their potential opportunities for climate action.12.30 ‚Äì Lunch Break (included in registration) 13.30 ‚Äì  Keynote: Jantien Borsboom, Pieternel Thijssen (Netherlands) ‚Äì Community participation in the SDGsSince 2016, the SDGs have been a framework for the library of Midden-Brabant.

Examples include creating and promoting shared resources or facilities (sharing economy), reducing consumption, using environmentally friendly library buildings and equipment, and demonstrating commitment to international environmental goals and programmes.Tim Schumann (Germany) ‚Äì The Berlin-Pankow Public Library Going Green The Berlin-Pankow Public Library is on its way to become a Green Library by embracing its role as an actor in an ecologically and socially sustainable future. This presentation will describe current measures of the library in terms of diversity, management, and partnerships, becoming a third place in the community, and how this relates to its goal of becoming a Green Library.Workshop: Helena √ñberg Carlsson (Sweden) ‚Äì Transition Stories Beyond Dystopia and Carbon RuinsThrough storytelling and sharing experiences, we can foster a sense of belonging and collective agency for change. This workshop is based on a scientific master narrative that has been used as a spinning wheel for a dynamic process involving public libraries in V√§stmanland County, Lund University, artists and local stakeholders, where it has initiated a process to reveal the potential of public libraries as arenas for transition and change.15.30 ‚Äì Coffee Break15.50 ‚Äì Panel Discussion and Closing:  CLIMATE ACTION: COUNT LIBRARIES IN!A panel of library leaders from around the world will come together to share and discuss the role of libraries as actors of climate empowerment.16.30 ‚Äì Self-guided Tour of LocHal and Social GatheringMÔªøore information can be found on our website:https://www.ifla.org/events/ifla-wlic-satellite-meeting-2023-libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment/ ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/bibliotheek-midden-brabant-and-ensulib-pls-64783058103,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment-tickets-623591016517,Amsterdam

Playground session on the ethics of drone design!,"September 26, 2023, 12:30 PM","September 26, 2023, 01:30 PM","5 Jaffalaan, 2628 BX Delft, Netherlands","The monthly playgrounds rotate between faculties. You are cordially invited to the upcoming playground on September 26th: 12.30 ‚Äì 13.30 at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. This playground is hosted by Salua Hamaza, Assistant Professor in Aerial Robotics, TU Delft Aerospace Engineering & TUD Robotics Institute Aerospace Representative and the Delft Design for Values Institute.We are honored to be joined by Dylan Cawthorne, Associate Professor at the Drone Center at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, who will share insights from his book The ethics of Drone Design.ProgrammeIntroduction Design for values Design for values in (Aerial) robotics The ethics of drone designDiscussion on the ethics/design principles of dronesQ&AAÔªøbout Dylan Cawthorne and his book on the ethics of drone designMy name is Dylan Cawthorne, and I am an Associate Professor at the Drone Center at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.  My goal is to make the world a better place using ethics, technology, art, and craft.  I see myself as a champion for the use of ethics and human values in engineering, and as an activist engineer.  My main area of research is using value sensitive design methods and ethical principles to design and build prototype drones - as documented in my PhD thesis and forthcoming book.  These drones are used in humanitarian and public healthcare contexts in Denmark, Africa, and beyond.  I am interested in utilizing art, craft, and creativity to enhance engineering - and engineering to inform art.  A common theme in my work is the support of de-centralized technologies and democratic, grassroots organizations and methods.  In 2021, I won the Inspiration Prize from my university for my work with the United Nations Sustainable Development goals.  You can read more about my background at this link, see an overview of my projects below, and read about my future work at the bottom of this page.This book presents a holistic approach to the design and use of drones. It argues that this powerful technology requires high levels of ethical analysis and responsibility‚Äîour moral progress must keep pace with our technological progress.  Drone technologies support and diminish the flourishing of certain human values, impact power relations between individuals and groups, and add an additional element to the complex network of humans and objects in modern society. The book begins by introducing four prototype drones designed and built by the author: the healthcare drone, the search and rescue drone, the mapping drone, and the spiritual drone. After presenting the technological aspects of each drone, the author considers their social contexts and ethical aspects. What is the use plan of each drone? Where will it operate? Will it support the flourishing of humans and of nature? Should this drone be built? The next part of the book showcases several methods used to develop the prototype drones from the fields of engineering, ethics, and art: value sensitive design, ethical frameworks, capability caution, and speculative design. These methods reveal a more subtle and nuanced view of drones than the currently polarized characterization of ‚Äúthe good drone‚Äù or ‚Äúthe killer drone‚Äù. The book concludes with specific recommendations for drone engineers, companies, lawmakers, and citizens.FÔªøurther information can be found here.AÔªøbout the Robotics InstituteTU Delft Robotics Institute unites all Delft University of Technology‚Äôs research in the field of robotics. Its main challenge is to get robots and humans to work together effectively in unstructured environments, and real settings.Within the institute both the ‚Äòhard‚Äô robot disciplines (mechatronics, embedded systems, control and Artificial Intelligence) and the ‚Äòsoft‚Äô robot sciences (human-machine interaction, user interaction, architecture, ethics, security and design) have a prominent presence. By joining forces, and aligning research, education and valorisation, TU Delft Robotics Institute takes a leading role in the creation of the next generation robots.FÔªøurther information can be found here.About the Delft Design for Values InstituteDesign for Values is aimed at systematically integrating values of moral importance in the design of products, services and systems from the start of the design process. The institute focuses on a broad range of values including safety, sustainability, privacy, justice & fairness, diversity & inclusion, and well-being, as well as on a wide range of domains and applications areas, like smart cities, healthcare, water management, infrastructure, energy, and consumer products.The Delft Design for Values Institute (DDfV) brings together expertise in design and (moral) values and is a collaboration between five faculties: TPM, IDE, BK, CTIG and EEMCS.

The focus will be on ‚ÄúLibraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment‚Äù. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans.

The center will draw on the special contributions of arts and culture, economics, ecological sciences, and personal development.To help kick off a wider public consideration of Schumacher NL, we are proud to announce that commons activist and scholar David Bollier will deliver the first annual Small Is Beautiful Lecture at the Kleine Aarde in Boxtel on September 14, 2023.

Het team werd opgericht in 2007 en heeft sindsdien verschillende waterstofraceauto's ontwikkeld en deelgenomen aan verschillende races en evenementen. Aansluitend geven zij een lezing met als thema: ""Driving the energy transition with hydrogen racing"".  Deze lezing wordt gegeven door Eva van der Dijs, teammanager Forze Hydrogen Racing team 17. De Forze VIII is gebaseerd op een bestaande sportwagen. Het is een krachtige raceauto met een waterstofbrandstofcel en een elektrische aandrijving. De brandstofcel zet waterstof om in elektriciteit, waardoor de auto snelheid en vermogen krijgt. Het heeft ook een batterijpakket om energie op te slaan en te gebruiken tijdens acceleratie en piekvermogen.De Forze VIII werd de eerste waterstofraceauto in de geschiedenis die deelnam aan een door de FIA gecertificeerde race. Op 18 augustus 2018 nam ze deel aan de sportdivisie van de Supercar Challenge tegen benzine-aangedreven supercars.In augustus 2019 vierde Forze haar grootste prestatie tot nu toe. De Forze VIII nam opnieuw deel aan de Supercar Challenge tijdens de Gamma Racing Days en eindigde als tweede in onze klasse. Dit succes benadrukte de capaciteit van het team en maakt ons nog enthousiaster over wat de toekomst voor ons in petto heeft.Op het circuit van Zandvoort heeft de Forze VIII het offici√´le ronderecord voor elektrische sportwagens met 1:55.809 tijdens een test waarbij de omstandigheden verre van ideaal waren.

Voor wie gelden die regels precies, wat houden de regels in en hoe kun je die extra administratieve last het beste opbrengen?  Voor de meesten van ons zijn de richtlijnen nieuw. Bovendien zijn ze niet allemaal even eenvoudig meetbaar te maken. Hoe kun je je voorbereiden op een rapportageverplichting waarvan zelfs de overheid op dit moment nog niet precies weet hoe die er in zijn definitieve vorm uit zal zien? We concentreren ons in deze workshop onder meer op de fasering van de invoering van de nieuwe Europese richtlijnen en op de praktische betekenis ervan. Verder behandelen we de vraag hoe je de invoering van verslaggeving over duurzaamheid het beste kunt aanvliegen.Paul van Geldorp is een inspirerende persoonlijkheid en momenteel de drijvende kracht achter Impact!|circulair.

Na zeven jaar in de bouw- en zeven in de woningcorporatiesector te hebben gewerkt was Jan Willem van 2010 tot 2016 verbonden aan het programma Energiesprong. Een rijksoverheidsprogramma dat werkte aan het  verduurzamingsvraagstuk van de gebouwde omgeving. Hij richtte zich daarbij op het versnellen van innovaties in de bouw- en woningcorporatiesector. Jan Willem is ondermeer bedenker en initiator van de Stroomversnelling. Een initiatief waarbij de bouw- en corporatiesector door middel van innovatie en industrialisatie (goedkoper, beter, duurzamer) woningen renoveren. Jan Willem is √©√©n van de oprichters van Factory Zero. Een snelgroeiend bedrijf dat industrieel energiemodules produceert voor zeer energiezuinige woningen.De winst van biobased bouwen voor boer en bouw - Als we de klimaatdoelen van Parijs willen halen √©n snel 900.000 woningen willen bouwen, dan moeten we de bouwsector, de landbouw en de industrie versneld verduurzamen. Biogrondstoffen vormen hiervoor de sleutel. Jan Willem van de Groep vertelt wat er nodig is om dat voor elkaar te krijgen en op welke manier de bouw en landbouw elkaar wederzijds kunnen versterken bij het bereiken van klimaat- en natuurdoelen. Op dit moment werkt Jan Willem aan: Een programma dat biobased bouwen moet stimuleren, versnellen en opschalen in opdracht van het ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit.Een onderzoek naar digitalisering van de renovatie- en verduurzamingsketen in opdracht van TKI urban energyEen programma voor een verduurzamingsaanpak van particulier woningbezit in opdracht van de Agem en de regio Achterhoek.Een kwartiermakersproject voor de uitrol van de contingentenaanpak voor het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koningkrijsrelaties in opdracht van TKI-urban energyHet opzetten van GIDEON ‚Äì Building Transition Tribe, een transitiebeweging die koplopers in de bouw moet helpen sneller op te schalen.VISIEDe bouwsector verandert de komende jaren razendsnel.

ProgrammaDe trainingsdag bestaat uit:1) Een introductie op Green-House-Gasses (GHG).2) Een deepdive in het GHG-protocol, de internationale standaard voor GHG footprint reporting.3) Scoping:  De hele value chain (scope 1, 2 en 3) wordt besproken. Met ruime aandacht voor typische GHG emissiebronnen en -waardes.4) Typische verbetermaatregelen om GHG-emissies te reduceren.5) Aandacht voor controles waarbij we je orde groottes leren ervaren van de uitstoot gerelateerd aan elektriciteitsverbruik, vervoer, inkoop van materiaal en afvalverwerking.De training bestaat afwisselend uit theorie, praktijkvoorbeelden en opdrachten. DocentenPaul van Ruiten is eigenaar van Bureau Om en al meer dan 25 jaar actief in het vakgebied milieu en duurzaamheid en werkte oa als klimaatexpert op de Nederlandse Ambassade in Washington en bij het ministerie in Den Haag.

We beginnen met het maken van een aantal verfbaden om textiel mee te verven. We gebruiken hiervoor plantaardig materiaal en verven kleine stukjes tweedehands katoen, gebeitst met een milieuvriendelijk beitsmiddel. De bloemen van het verfbad komen uit de tuin van het museum en we maken gebruik van restmaterialen uit de keuken van het museumcaf√©.Onderdeel van de workshop is een rondleiding door de tentoonstelling van textielkunstenaar Claudy Jongstra en eco-kunstenaar en scheikundige Cristina Lucas. Na de rondleiding zijn de verfbaden klaar voor gebruik en gaan we katoen verven. Daarna gaan we inkt maken van gedroogde bloemen en plantaardig extract. Door het spelen met PH-verschuivingen, verandert de kleur. Met deze inkt maken we proefjes op papier, dit worden ware kunstwerken. Aan het einde van de workshop heeft u genoeg kennis opgedaan om thuis verder te experimenteren met materiaal uit de keuken en bloemen of planten uit eigen tuin en omgeving!Over de workshopdocent Janneke HuijnkJanneke Huijnk werkt als zelfstandig illustrator en is docent ambachtelijke druktechnieken. Ze heeft Grafische vormgeving gestudeerd aan de HKU en Wijsbegeerte aan de UvA. Janneke is gespecialiseerd in natuurlijk verven en maakt haar inkten van plantaardig materiaal.

A New Landscape: Data Representation and Analysis Workshop,"April 04, 2024, 08:00 AM","April 05, 2024, 04:00 PM","45 Sportlaan, 1185 TB Amstelveen, Netherlands","The focus of this new workshop is the development of children‚Äôs emerging ideas and strategies regarding data analysis and representation‚Äîarguably one of the most important mathematical strands for the future.There are many ways to represent data and visually communicate relationships, and different models have different assets and limitations to do so. They allow us to see different things and to ask different questions. However, just showing a graph does not mean children are able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the mathematics in it. The mathematics is not in the model to be seen; it is in the child‚Äôs mind. For this reason, as we work to develop children‚Äôs understanding of data and representation we go back and forth: 1) from the mathematics, to the representation of it; and, 2) from the representation and the questions that arise given the shape of the data, to the mathematics. The tools used initially as models of informal mathematical activity become models for thinking. Over the last two years, Cathy has released 6 new units on the development of data and representation, as well as a new landscape of learning‚Äîa learning trajectory comprised of big ideas, strategies, and models based on research on how children come to understand data representation and analysis. The work was co-authored with Koeno Gravemeijer and Frans Van Galen, researchers who previously worked at The Freudenthal Institute in The Netherlands. The workshop will make use of new videos from classrooms, engage participants in analysis of student work, and it will provide rich contexts from children‚Äôs lives purposefully crafted to ensure  mathematical development through the K-6 years. Learn about contexts for teaching data and representation that just beg to be mathematized!Empower your students to think like mathematicians using a math workshop modelStudy with Cathy the new Landscape of Learning (learning trajectory) for data representation and analysis.Explore and learn to do minilessons crafted with strings designed to ensure the development of numeracy as it relates to data representation and analysis.Choose a grade span breakout group and learn about investigations that you can do with your students to foster the development of data representation and analysis. Take home a new learning trajectory, a free unit to try with your students, and a month of free access to P2S2: a personalized professional support system from New Perspectives Online.	  	Presenter(s) Bio:Catherine FosnotCathy Fosnot is Professor Emerita of Childhood Education, CCNY/CUNY, where she was the Founding Director of the NSF-funded project Mathematics in the City and was the recipient of the Teacher of the Year Award. She is also an award-winning author of many books, among them: Conferring with Young Mathematicians at Work: Making Moments Matter; Models of Intervention in Mathematics Education: Reweaving the Tapestry (NCTM and Pearson); Young Mathematicians at Work (with Maarten Dolk and Bill Jacob) a series of 4 books on numeracy and algebra published by Heinemann in the U.S. and distributed in Canada by Pearson); Reconstructing Math Education (with Deborah Schifter); and Constructivism: Theory, Perspectives and Practice (Teachers College Press). In 2012 Cathy left the university to establish New Perspectives on Learning, a company focused on professional development and system-wide change, offering professional development workshops and on-site consulting with schools around the world and at the company‚Äôs two workshop centers in the U.S. (in New London, CT and San Francisco, CA.). In 2020 she and her team completed Contexts for Learning Mathematics (CFLM), now a full core inquiry-based, hybrid, K-5 program. Over the last several years, the work has expanded with the establishment of two more companies New Perspectives Online, a video-based platform for teacher learning, and New Perspectives on Assessment, a web-based app for formative assessment with teaching implications, aligned with the CCSS. Early in her career, Cathy was the recipient of the Young Scholar Award from the Association for Educational Communication and Technology for her writing on technology and education. The American Educational Research Association Special Interest Group on Constructivism has twice awarded her their ‚Äúsignificant contribution‚Äù award. She is also the senior content consultant for DreamBox Learning and has been since its inception. Maarten DolkFor many years, Maarten was a researcher and developer of mathematics education at the Freudenthal Institute in the Netherlands, where he was involved in the development of professional development and multimedia learning environments for teachers. He has also directed a professional development project in the Netherlands for teacher educators and staff developers.

Playground session on the ethics of drone design!,"September 26, 2023, 12:30 PM","September 26, 2023, 01:30 PM","5 Jaffalaan, 2628 BX Delft, Netherlands","The monthly playgrounds rotate between faculties. You are cordially invited to the upcoming playground on September 26th: 12.30 ‚Äì 13.30 at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. This playground is hosted by Salua Hamaza, Assistant Professor in Aerial Robotics, TU Delft Aerospace Engineering & TUD Robotics Institute Aerospace Representative and the Delft Design for Values Institute.We are honored to be joined by Dylan Cawthorne, Associate Professor at the Drone Center at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, who will share insights from his book The ethics of Drone Design.ProgrammeIntroduction Design for values Design for values in (Aerial) robotics The ethics of drone designDiscussion on the ethics/design principles of dronesQ&AAÔªøbout Dylan Cawthorne and his book on the ethics of drone designMy name is Dylan Cawthorne, and I am an Associate Professor at the Drone Center at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.  My goal is to make the world a better place using ethics, technology, art, and craft.  I see myself as a champion for the use of ethics and human values in engineering, and as an activist engineer.  My main area of research is using value sensitive design methods and ethical principles to design and build prototype drones - as documented in my PhD thesis and forthcoming book.  These drones are used in humanitarian and public healthcare contexts in Denmark, Africa, and beyond.  I am interested in utilizing art, craft, and creativity to enhance engineering - and engineering to inform art.  A common theme in my work is the support of de-centralized technologies and democratic, grassroots organizations and methods.  In 2021, I won the Inspiration Prize from my university for my work with the United Nations Sustainable Development goals.  You can read more about my background at this link, see an overview of my projects below, and read about my future work at the bottom of this page.This book presents a holistic approach to the design and use of drones. It argues that this powerful technology requires high levels of ethical analysis and responsibility‚Äîour moral progress must keep pace with our technological progress.  Drone technologies support and diminish the flourishing of certain human values, impact power relations between individuals and groups, and add an additional element to the complex network of humans and objects in modern society. The book begins by introducing four prototype drones designed and built by the author: the healthcare drone, the search and rescue drone, the mapping drone, and the spiritual drone. After presenting the technological aspects of each drone, the author considers their social contexts and ethical aspects. What is the use plan of each drone? Where will it operate? Will it support the flourishing of humans and of nature? Should this drone be built? The next part of the book showcases several methods used to develop the prototype drones from the fields of engineering, ethics, and art: value sensitive design, ethical frameworks, capability caution, and speculative design. These methods reveal a more subtle and nuanced view of drones than the currently polarized characterization of ‚Äúthe good drone‚Äù or ‚Äúthe killer drone‚Äù. The book concludes with specific recommendations for drone engineers, companies, lawmakers, and citizens.FÔªøurther information can be found here.AÔªøbout the Robotics InstituteTU Delft Robotics Institute unites all Delft University of Technology‚Äôs research in the field of robotics. Its main challenge is to get robots and humans to work together effectively in unstructured environments, and real settings.Within the institute both the ‚Äòhard‚Äô robot disciplines (mechatronics, embedded systems, control and Artificial Intelligence) and the ‚Äòsoft‚Äô robot sciences (human-machine interaction, user interaction, architecture, ethics, security and design) have a prominent presence. By joining forces, and aligning research, education and valorisation, TU Delft Robotics Institute takes a leading role in the creation of the next generation robots.FÔªøurther information can be found here.About the Delft Design for Values InstituteDesign for Values is aimed at systematically integrating values of moral importance in the design of products, services and systems from the start of the design process. The institute focuses on a broad range of values including safety, sustainability, privacy, justice & fairness, diversity & inclusion, and well-being, as well as on a wide range of domains and applications areas, like smart cities, healthcare, water management, infrastructure, energy, and consumer products.The Delft Design for Values Institute (DDfV) brings together expertise in design and (moral) values and is a collaboration between five faculties: TPM, IDE, BK, CTIG and EEMCS. DDfV is directed by prof. dr. ir. Ibo van de Poel. The Management Board consists of representatives of the five participating faculties: Carola Hein/Rachel Lee (BK), Edo Abraham (CiTG), Marina Bos‚ÄìDe Vos (IDE), Megha Khosla (EEMCS), and Michael Klenk (TBM) and Marielle Feenstra (TBM ‚Äì Coordination DDfV), and Maria Novas Ferradas (BK ‚Äì Coordination DDfV).The institute has formulated the following four ambitions for the next five years:Consolidating DDfV as an international leading knowledge institute in the field of design and values,Acquiring external funding for interdisciplinary research on Design for Values,Integrating Design for Values in educational programs at the TU Delft,Increasing external visibility through an annual theme.For 2023 the annual theme is Design for Justice.If you have questions or are interested in our activities, you can reach us at info@delftdesignforvalues.nlFÔªøurther information can be found here ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/design-for-values-institute-63508538483,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/playground-session-on-the-ethics-of-drone-design-tickets-675002389317,Amsterdam

The focus will be on ‚ÄúLibraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment‚Äù. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans.

Based on the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap defines key development areas and sets out implementation plans. It focuses on promoting environmental awareness, reducing environmental impact and responsible construction, with the aim that sustainable development permeates all areas of the library‚Äôs daily work. This presentation will outline the roadmap and how it is being used as a long-term tool for climate action in Oulu City Library in Finland.Sarah Tribelhorn (USA) ‚Äì Bringing the SDGs Alive in an Academic LibraryThe San Diego State University Library has mapped its work to the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of employee roles, projects, and the library website. The process culminated in an exhibition that led to an engaging community discussion and challenged students, staff, and faculty to think critically about how they can contribute to these goals. This presentation will describe the process as a catalyst for community engagement, partnerships, and empowerment around climate awareness and the SDGs.Nathalice Bezerra Cardoso (Brazil) ‚Äì Challenges of the SDGs: Case Study of the German LibrariesThe SDGs have gained prominence in recent years, and there has been increased discussion on the role and social responsibilities of libraries regarding this issue. This presentation will provide an understanding of how German libraries are contributing to the SDGs. Do the people who are working in the libraries know what the SDGs are about?? Which SDGs are addressed by German public libraries? What services and actions are being developed in German libraries to achieve the SDGs?11.00 ‚Äì  Coffee Break 11.30 ‚Äì Workshops Workshop 1: Beth Filar Williams (USA) ‚Äì Inner Development Goals: A Collaborative Exploration WorkshopThe Inner Development Goals (IDGs) are a framework for accelerating our work towards the SDGs, co-created by diverse, international experts in response to current crises. The IDGs can help us access the deep level beneath the structures so that we can work on ourselves and how we relate to others, care for the world and create change. Participants will be invited to explore this framework in small groups ‚Äì shifting awareness, connecting with each other and the earth. Workshop 2: Liselotte Dessauvagie (Netherlands) ‚Äì SDGs Bookclub: For a Better Future!An SDGs Bookclub is an annotated list of selected books that teachers and librarians can use to discuss and explore the SDGs with children (and adults). Suggestions for teaching will accompany the book selection. In this workshop, the Dutch version of the SDGs Bookclub will be presented and the selection will be discussed. Participants will work on a small SDGs Bookclub during the session and explore how the SDGs can help build a better future for all through books.Workshop 3: Daniel Hackborn (Canada) ‚Äì MACK Framework: Situating Climate Action in Local Library ContextsWhile anthropogenic global warming is inherently a global issue demanding systemic action, developing responses at a local institutional level can be overwhelming. In this workshop, we will introduce the Mitigation-Adaptation-Community-Knowledge (MACK) conceptual model and, using Amiskwaciw√¢skahikan (Edmonton), Canada as a guiding case study, illustrate how this model can be applied to other local libraries in order to clarify and analyse their potential opportunities for climate action.12.30 ‚Äì Lunch Break (included in registration) 13.30 ‚Äì  Keynote: Jantien Borsboom, Pieternel Thijssen (Netherlands) ‚Äì Community participation in the SDGsSince 2016, the SDGs have been a framework for the library of Midden-Brabant.

The focus will be on ‚ÄúLibraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment‚Äù. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans.

It focuses on promoting environmental awareness, reducing environmental impact and responsible construction, with the aim that sustainable development permeates all areas of the library‚Äôs daily work. This presentation will outline the roadmap and how it is being used as a long-term tool for climate action in Oulu City Library in Finland.Sarah Tribelhorn (USA) ‚Äì Bringing the SDGs Alive in an Academic LibraryThe San Diego State University Library has mapped its work to the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of employee roles, projects, and the library website. The process culminated in an exhibition that led to an engaging community discussion and challenged students, staff, and faculty to think critically about how they can contribute to these goals. This presentation will describe the process as a catalyst for community engagement, partnerships, and empowerment around climate awareness and the SDGs.Nathalice Bezerra Cardoso (Brazil) ‚Äì Challenges of the SDGs: Case Study of the German LibrariesThe SDGs have gained prominence in recent years, and there has been increased discussion on the role and social responsibilities of libraries regarding this issue. This presentation will provide an understanding of how German libraries are contributing to the SDGs. Do the people who are working in the libraries know what the SDGs are about?? Which SDGs are addressed by German public libraries? What services and actions are being developed in German libraries to achieve the SDGs?11.00 ‚Äì  Coffee Break 11.30 ‚Äì Workshops Workshop 1: Beth Filar Williams (USA) ‚Äì Inner Development Goals: A Collaborative Exploration WorkshopThe Inner Development Goals (IDGs) are a framework for accelerating our work towards the SDGs, co-created by diverse, international experts in response to current crises. The IDGs can help us access the deep level beneath the structures so that we can work on ourselves and how we relate to others, care for the world and create change. Participants will be invited to explore this framework in small groups ‚Äì shifting awareness, connecting with each other and the earth. Workshop 2: Liselotte Dessauvagie (Netherlands) ‚Äì SDGs Bookclub: For a Better Future!An SDGs Bookclub is an annotated list of selected books that teachers and librarians can use to discuss and explore the SDGs with children (and adults).

Thinking About Disability and Climate Change,"September 20, 2023, 01:30 PM","September 20, 2023, 03:00 PM","12 East 41st Street Room 701, New York, NY 10017","Disability must be addressed as an important part of climate policy because it is present in every race, sex, class, sexual preference, age, and everything else.  Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don‚Äôt understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ¬∑	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ¬∑	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ¬∑	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ¬∑	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,¬∑	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right. Together, we can create a just, sustainable future for everyone.

As global leaders gather in New York for the UN Climate Ambition Summit and General Assembly, we are calling on governments to reckon with their role in fueling climate chaos, and harm against frontline communities and the planet  by continuing the extraction of fossil fuels . We only have a limited amount of years left to address and mitigate the worst impacts of the  climate crisis.For years, global climate movements have been calling for governments to phase out fossil fuels and stop expansion. We continue to pressure governments, corporations, and financial institutions to adhere to the demands of  science and communities, and implement an immediate equitable phaseout of fossil fuels. Instead, governments must invest in and deploy a Just Transition that is grounded in a climate justice framework and uplifts care economies, community-led solutions, Indigenous rights,  and a different vision than business as usual.During this event, we will host two panels, please see below for descriptions.‚ÄúWomen Ending the Era of Fossil Fuels‚ÄùDuring this panel discussion, global women leaders will share expertise and frameworks for transitioning away from extraction and share ongoing policy advocacy and campaigns that seek to phase out fossil fuels, deforestation, and other harmful extractive practices. ‚ÄúWomen-led Climate Solutions Are Central to a Just Transition and Thriving  Future‚ÄùIn the second panel we will hear from  global women leaders and policy experts on how to implement and support  solutions that are advancing  a Just Transition.

As social and ecological crises escalate globally, it is clear that the dominant cultural worldview, informed by colonization, patriarchy, capitalism, and racism is displaying a relationship with Nature and each other that is devastatingly unjust and out of balance. To live in a healthy and equitable world, we must fundamentally change how we respect and interact with the Earth and one another. To change the present and future, it is imperative to change the narrative and amplify worldviews and stories of climate justice solutions that transform the dominant worldview from an extractivist, colonial paradigm of ‚Äúexploit and extract‚Äù to a sustainable, globally-conscious one of ‚Äúrespect and restore.‚ÄùAt this event, movement leaders and change-makers will weave together stories, worldviews, and experiences of restoration and justice that demonstrate the healthy and equitable world we know is possible and needed. We knew in our bones this time was coming, and now we must act in solidarity more than ever, continuing to build a powerful movement founded on principles of justice, love, and a fierce dedication to our planet and our communities.This event is also the pre-launch of the forthcoming book by Osprey Orielle Lake, ""The Story is in Our Bones: How Worldviews and Climate Justice Can Remake a World in Crisis,"" to be released in January 2024.

Urbanization, population growth, and climate change have led to challenges with solid and hazardous waste generation and disposal, and has put stress on water resources. This year‚Äôs lab investigates the ways that designers, artists, creative technologists, policy makers, activists, and educators are working to deal with these impacts and what projects are being undertaken to mitigate these risks. The statistics outline a worsening situation.Globally the average person generates 1.6 lbs of waste per day and total waste will rise as the world‚Äôs population increases. Even as waste treatment methods have improved, a lot of waste ends up in dump sites and only ‚Äú20 percent of waste is recycled each year‚Äù (Alves, 2023). Hazardous waste, which is especially harmful ‚Äì coming from dyes, metals in batteries and electronics, and solvents ‚Äì suffers from inadequate household awareness and lack of industry compliance. Clean water and water systems are taken for granted in many parts of society just as many rivers and lakes have ‚Äúdried up‚Äù or have become ‚Äútoo polluted to use‚Äù ‚Äî and it is expected that by 2025, ‚Äútwo-thirds of the world‚Äôs population may face water shortages.‚Äù (WWF, 2023).

Applied Panarchy in Environmental Science (HS),"July 31, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 04, 2023, 03:00 PM","160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031","Leaders:  Glen StuartDates: July 31-August 4, 2023 (9:00-3:00pm EDT, in person at City College)About the WorkshopThis workshop will explore active learning strategies for deepening your students‚Äô understanding of crucial concepts in environmental and sustainability science and help you effectively implement a student-centered and NGSS aligned approach to science education. Whether you are an experienced teacher, or new to the teaching profession you will feel excited and motivated for your upcoming school year after participating in this highly immersive and collaborative workshop. Participants will engage in thought-provoking, pertinent experiments, and activities that you can utilize in your own classroom. We will spend time observing instruction from the point of view of a student (‚Äústudent-mode‚Äù), and learn strategies to incorporate in their own classroom using the claim, evidence, reasoning (CER) framework, Social Ecological Systems (SES), transdisciplinary thinking, and panarchy as tools to probe student preconceptions. Periodically, participants will switch to ‚Äúteacher-mode‚Äù, to practice Socratic questioning techniques, analyze readings, and discuss the pedagogical rationale for all aspects of active learning and modeling in Environmental Science. We‚Äôll also discuss strategies for accommodating district-specific curricular requirements, various student populations, laboratory resources, and the use of ‚ÄúReflective Checklists‚Äù as a way of promoting student reflection throughout a unit.Monday, 7/31: Art of TeachingAM - Dive into the essential question + your vision of educationPM - Use a lesson on Resilience to circle back to your vision of educationTuesday, 8/1: Science of TeachingAM - Dive into different pedagogical practices: modeling pedagogy, development deployment, pedagogy of hope, pedagogy of the oppressed + Create experimental designs for ecological successionPM - Dive into an activity where you and a partner are reconciling the differences while protecting the commons + case study of environmental and public healthWednesday, 8/2: Design of TeachingAM - Systems thinking activity + connect to Monday and Tuesday's themesPM - Design a thinking activity where you practice empathy, choose an issue, and design a solution in preparation for Baby Step Lesson on FridayThursday, 8/3: Empathy of TeachingAM - Climate change deep dive with evidence and MEL diagrams, Choose your own adventure game based on The TerritoryPM - Group planning/coaching for baby step lessonsFriday, 8/4: Baby Step LessonsAM/PM - Lesson planning in groups + feedbackThe Applied Panarchy in Environmental Science curriculum curriculum blends a humanities-based lens with scientific methods to create a transdisciplinary approach, to empower students to live more sustainable lives. Panarchy transcends the boundaries of scale and discipline. Most importantly, the panarchy model advocates a transition from a static understanding of nature to a dynamic idea that places an emphasis on multiple stable states, resilience, and cross-scale interactions that result in adaptive change. The adaptive cycle ‚Äì  in its development, deployment, and representation ‚Äì ties each of the units of the APES curriculum together.

AÔªø smoke-free future is attainable through policy and technological innovation. TÔªøhe New Approaches conference investigates how policy innovation and technological innovation can complement each other in preventing 8 million tobacco-related deaths annually, and up to 1 billion tobacco-related deaths this century.The 2023 healthcare conference evaluates progress achieved from policy frameworks such as the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control (FCTC) at its 20th anniversary. Can policy innovation overcome stagnation and accelerate an end to smoking in the years to come? The current state of progress in ending smoking in the USA and other countries will be presented. IÔªønvestments in innovation and sustainability can help meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG (3) on health, SDG (6) on clean water, SDG (12) on responsible consumption, SDG (13) on climate change. The conference will investigate how medicinally licensed Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), pharmaceutical Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRTs), modern consumer nicotine, and tobacco-free nicotine solutions can work synergistically to improve the lives of millions and accelerate efforts to end smoking.  By integrating global perspectives from research, public governance, private industry, innovation, finance, and new voices this conference considers tobacco harm reduction as an integral part of tobacco control and a policy option to improve human health and a sustainable future. The Summit is open to all stakeholders who are committed to ending smoking. Tickets for New Approaches to Tobacco Control include admission to a combined networking cocktail-hour and research poster exposition.  We are currently accepting abstracts for submission.

New Approaches Conference: NYC 2023,"September 18, 2023, 08:00 AM","September 18, 2023, 06:00 PM","35 West 44th Street, New York, NY 10036","Hosted during United Nations week, the second annual New Approaches to Tobacco Control Conference (NATC) will take place on Monday, September 18th, 2023, at the Harvard Club of New York City in Midtown, Manhattan.  AÔªø smoke-free future is attainable through policy and technological innovation. TÔªøhe New Approaches conference investigates how policy innovation and technological innovation can complement each other in preventing 8 million tobacco-related deaths annually, and up to 1 billion tobacco-related deaths this century.The 2023 healthcare conference evaluates progress achieved from policy frameworks such as the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control (FCTC) at its 20th anniversary. Can policy innovation overcome stagnation and accelerate an end to smoking in the years to come? The current state of progress in ending smoking in the USA and other countries will be presented. IÔªønvestments in innovation and sustainability can help meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG (3) on health, SDG (6) on clean water, SDG (12) on responsible consumption, SDG (13) on climate change. The conference will investigate how medicinally licensed Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), pharmaceutical Nicotine Replacement Therapies (NRTs), modern consumer nicotine, and tobacco-free nicotine solutions can work synergistically to improve the lives of millions and accelerate efforts to end smoking.  By integrating global perspectives from research, public governance, private industry, innovation, finance, and new voices this conference considers tobacco harm reduction as an integral part of tobacco control and a policy option to improve human health and a sustainable future. The Summit is open to all stakeholders who are committed to ending smoking. Tickets for New Approaches to Tobacco Control include admission to a combined networking cocktail-hour and research poster exposition.  We are currently accepting abstracts for submission.

Here at the park, we think public spaces can be spaces for engagement, continued education, and discussion; ""Nature & Urbanism"" is part of an initiative to introduce more programming that helps adults learn & grow beyond the classroom.Cities have never been neutral spaces. They are in constant flux and the very embodiment of politics in action. While we‚Äôre used to seeing cities as sites of resistance and revolutionary possibility (e.g. Stonewall, Black Lives Matter, Anti-War protests), we tend to overlook the politics of the built environment itself.What makes a space natural or unnatural? And how do you know nature when you see it? These three talks will cover how we‚Äôve created a specter called ‚Äònature‚Äô, and how that creation determines who gets to use, rest, and belong in our cities and our public places.MÔªøeet in the seating area next to the Fog Bridge (pier reveal).PÔªøresented in partnership with Think Olio: https://www.olio.rsvp/",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/domino-park-66253912513,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nature-urbanism-tickets-668352068027,NYC

As social and ecological crises escalate globally, it is clear that the dominant cultural worldview, informed by colonization, patriarchy, capitalism, and racism is displaying a relationship with Nature and each other that is devastatingly unjust and out of balance. To live in a healthy and equitable world, we must fundamentally change how we respect and interact with the Earth and one another. To change the present and future, it is imperative to change the narrative and amplify worldviews and stories of climate justice solutions that transform the dominant worldview from an extractivist, colonial paradigm of ‚Äúexploit and extract‚Äù to a sustainable, globally-conscious one of ‚Äúrespect and restore.‚ÄùAt this event, movement leaders and change-makers will weave together stories, worldviews, and experiences of restoration and justice that demonstrate the healthy and equitable world we know is possible and needed. We knew in our bones this time was coming, and now we must act in solidarity more than ever, continuing to build a powerful movement founded on principles of justice, love, and a fierce dedication to our planet and our communities.This event is also the pre-launch of the forthcoming book by Osprey Orielle Lake, ""The Story is in Our Bones: How Worldviews and Climate Justice Can Remake a World in Crisis,"" to be released in January 2024.

Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don‚Äôt understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ¬∑	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ¬∑	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ¬∑	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ¬∑	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,¬∑	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right. Together, we can create a just, sustainable future for everyone.

Kids today are growing up in a different time that isn‚Äôt comparable to any other period of the past. At the moment, a 20th Century approach to 21st Century problems simply isn‚Äôt yielding the results we need. It seems like every year there is something new that is supposed to be the answer to the challenging behaviors we face today. The only constant of all of these initiatives is that they're all flawed. If we're being honest, we also have to admit that they all have some good qualities though. In education, we have a tendency to approach deep-rooted problems with surface-level thinking which often leads to surface-level solutions.During this two-day workshop, we work together to delve into these deep-rooted problems with an appropriate depth of thinking which should yield the solutions you need to address the behavior challenges on your campus. We encourage you to join us both days but feel free to only come to the day that fits your schedule and/or interest. Please take a moment to review the descriptions of the days below so you can learn what you should expect from attending each day of the workshop.DAY 1 - RESTORATIVE PRACTICES: ALTERNATIVES TO SUSPENSION ‚ÄãThe concept of Restorative Practices in schools is fairly new. There are challenges in the early stages of anything new, and Restorative Practices is no exception. The greatest challenge is refuting the idea that Restorative Practices should replace traditional consequences and punishment should be eliminated. Ideally, this makes sense, but realistically, it cannot work. There will always be a need for traditional consequences in schools because there will always be situations that require us to use strategies such as in-school or out-of-school suspension. The key word to remember here is strategies. Suspension is a strategy, not a solution, and a strategy is derived from an intended goal.FOCUS #1: HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ACCOUNTABILITYAlthough Restorative Practices is necessary, it can be just as flawed as traditional consequences if executed in isolation. Restorative Practices focuses on explicitly teaching behavior to students in an effort to change undesired behavior, whereas traditional consequences are used to punish for an inappropriate behavior when we believe students should have known that what they were doing was wrong. Our goal in both instances is accountability, and the path to accountability in schools can be achieved only by making restorative practices and traditional consequences work hand in hand.FOCUS #2: ALTERNATIVES TO IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION (ISS)If we're being honest, in-school suspension has some benefits.  By and large, most students resent being assigned in-school suspension primarily because of the social isolation. Most administrators can corroborate this from firsthand experiences of students pleading for out of school suspension instead of in-school suspension. Many students would prefer to serve their punishment at home rather than being isolated from their peers at school. The greatest flaw of ISS is that you are removing the student from the learning environment and it is relatively impossible to replicate the learning environment you are removing the student from. We convince ourselves that we are still educating these students by providing them with work from their teachers and a staff member in the room, usually a paraprofessional, to ""teach"" students as needed. In reality, the overuse of ISS serves as a temporary solution that often compounds the underlying problem which eventually creates irreparable harm to the school. We have to find alternatives that extract the benefits of ISS but also compensates where ISS is deficient.FOCUS #3: PARTNERING WITH PARENTS TO HOLD STUDENTS ACCOUNTABLEOne thing that almost everyone can agree on is parenting today is drastically different than it was years ago. Many educators believe parents of students today are responsible for why we are currently seeing such a widespread of adversarial behavior in schools. You can debate whether we have a parent problem or societal problem in our country but one thing that we do know is that pointing fingers or playing the blame game isn't going to solve this problem. In fact, one could argue that the lack of trust between schools and parents is the primary barrier preventing educators from getting a handle on this problem. Leveraging partnerships with parents is paramount if educators have any hope at finding solutions to the behavior problems in our schools today. This can only be accomplished if we can convince parents to partner with us to work together in the best interest of their child rather than act as their kids' defense attorneys as many parents currently do.Day 1 of the workshop will provide participants with:a Discipline Decision-Making Process that helps ensure decision makers are making thoughtful and thorough decisions when addressing students who need to be held accountable for their behavior.a framework for creating Highly Effective Accountability that is designed to change the adverse behavior while maintaining the idea of some traditional consequences.how in-school suspension can be modified to minimize the amount of time a student is removed from the learning environment by strategically working to change the underlying behaviorsspecific alternatives to in-school suspension that can be effective in minimizing the need for traditional in-school suspensionhow educators can partner with parents in the accountability process to change adverse behaviorspecific interventions that seamlessly allow parents to be a part of the accountability processDAY 1 - WHAT TO EXPECTDAY 2 - THE ART & SCIENCE OF CHANGING BEHAVIORThe number one intention of giving students consequences is to hopefully change their behavior.  It‚Äôs safe to say no one has ever assigned a consequence without the goal of the student coming out of the consequence with a changed behavior. With that said, our problem at the moment is that many of our students‚Äô behavior don‚Äôt change for the better after they‚Äôve completed the assigned consequences. Whether you suspend students, in-school or out-of-school, for one, five or even ten days, the results are typically the same. They come back into the school or the classroom with the same disruptive behavior that resulted in their removal. Changing behavior requires intentionality, persistence and patience which isn‚Äôt an easy process. This training focuses on providing participants with a logical understanding about how behavior changes and the creative process for how to change behavior. FOCUS #1: TRANSFORMING TRADITIONAL CONSEQUENCESIt‚Äôs unrealistic and counterproductive to remove traditional consequences such as in-school suspension and forms of detention from schools. The issue isn‚Äôt whether they should exist but rather how to make them effective when they are necessary. When a student‚Äôs behavior is jeopardizing the integrity of the learning environment, they need to be temporarily removed from the learning environment. With that said, removing disruptive students from the learning environment is a short-term and surface level solution that, in many cases, perpetuates deeper problems. It temporarily makes us feel comfortable that something was done to address the problem but often leads to further frustration once the students return to the learning environment. The reason why many of our disruptive students‚Äô behavior rarely change is because we rarely work to change their behavior. We assume that the punishment alone will change their behavior but the only way to change their behavior is to identify the root causes and actively work on the behavior. Many of our current traditional consequences naturally provide the structure that is necessary to allow us to work on challenging student behavior. We simply need to reimagine how these traditional consequences should look if we want better outcomes. FOCUS #2: OBJECTIVE QUESTIONINGIf you think about it, how receptive are you to unsolicited advice from an authority figure? The honest answer for most people is not too receptive. In most cases when people give advice, they are genuinely sharing their perspective to help another person. But in so many cases, advice falls on deaf ears because the person receiving the advice  isn‚Äôt receptive. It‚Äôs mind-boggling to most when they give someone what they believe is good advice, but the person‚Äôs response becomes defensive or defiant. Ironically, when the advice giver becomes the receiver, they often find themselves not too receptive either. The reason for this is people typically don‚Äôt like being told when they might be doing something wrong. A changed behavior is a personal choice that cannot be forced upon someone. The intention of the advice giver isn‚Äôt the problem in most cases. The real problem is that the greatest challenge is the delivery. As the advice giver, we believe we are teaching when we share our advice, but the advice receiver feels they are being preached to. Nobody likes to be preached to and the result is people either get defensive or shut down. If a changed behavior is a personal choice, personal reflection is required. One of the best strategies to assist with guiding someone down the path of personal reflection is the use of objective questions. Most people are familiar with the common objective questions used in Restorative Practices, such as what happened, what were you thinking of at the time, who has been affected by what you have done, and what do you think you need to do to make things right? These are great examples of foundational objective questions, but they cannot be used as a script. If the goal is a changed behavior, there must be a conscious effort to customize objective questions that encourage personal reflection. Objective Questioning is the practice of asking intuitive questions that enables a person to be reflective rather than defensive. FOCUS #3: ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECTS‚ÄùBusy Work‚Äù is one of the most counterproductive things we assign students in education. It‚Äôs typically assigned to students with punitive intentions to pass time when a student is serving a consequence. Busy works comes in many forms such as make-up work, a written apology, or reflection sheets. For example, we place students in in-school suspension and provide them with assignments to work on from their teachers. The idea behind this is that the student will be able to keep up with the instruction that is taking place in the classrooms while they serve their punishment. But too often, that isn‚Äôt how it works. The greatest flaw of ISS is that it is virtually impossible to replicate the learning environment you are removing the student from. We convince ourselves that we are still educating these students by providing them with work from their teachers and by having a staff member in the room, usually a paraprofessional, to ‚Äúteach‚Äù them as needed. While well intentioned, the assigning of ‚Äúbusy work‚Äù in these instances doesn‚Äôt yield us the results we are looking for and, in some cases, it does more harm than good.Day 2 of the workshop will provide participants with:how they can transform traditional consequences into frameworks that intentionally work to change student behavior while maintaining the structure of traditional consequenceshow to use objective questioning that is intuitive and encourages students to genuinely reflect about their behaviorhow to incorporate Structured Days, facilitate Restorative Circles and develop Accountability Projects that work together towards changing students' behaviorshow to incorporate the necessary stakeholders (i.e., teacher, parents, community members, etc.) in the school‚Äôs community to support efforts in changing the adverse behavior of some studentsDAY 2 - WHAT TO EXPECTABOUT THE PRESENTERKELVIN OLIVER is an Educational Consultant specializing in implementing Restorative Practices in Schools. As a campus administrator he played an instrumental role in the development, implementation, and support of Restorative Practices. Kelvin is credited for creating a Restorative Practices campus-based support model that included weekly professional development and an implementation support team. Since 2007, he has worked in education as a special education teacher, classroom teacher, campus math specialist, district curriculum specialist, assistant principal, campus principal and consultant.For more information about Kelvin‚Äôs work, please visit www.leavingthevillage.com.FAQsWhat's the cancellation/refund policy for this workshop?If you are unable to attend and need to request a refund, you must submit your refund request in writing SEVEN (7) DAYS prior to the scheduled date of the workshop. Submit all refund requests to billing@leavingthevillage.com. If you submit your refund request within  SEVEN (7) DAYS of the workshop, you can be provided with a credit that can be applied to any of our future workshops. Should I attend if I've already attended an Alternatives To Suspension and/or Guide To Implementing Restorative Practices virtual workshop series?Almost all of the strategies and concepts presented in the three virtual workshop sessions in both series will be presented again during the in-person workshops. With that said, the in-person workshops provide a greater opportunity to give more context because all of the strategies are presented in a day versus over the course of three 90-minute sessions.  The in-person workshops also provide an opportunity for hands-on learning activities that can't be duplicated virtually. The in-person workshop would be beneficial for those who have attended our virtual workshops but would like a refresher with some hands-on learning opportunities.Is this workshop beneficial for elementary educators?Our  workshops are differentiated to meet the needs of all levels, K-12. With that said, Kelvin Oliver, the presenter, was a PK-6 campus administrator when he implemented Restorative Practices on a campus. His time as a campus administrator is where he developed many of the concepts that are presented during these workshops. While the focus will be on all grade levels, elementary educators will not walk away from this workshop feeling that it didn't apply to them.Are these workshops only intended for administrators?No, you don't have to be an administrator to attend these workshops. All educators that attend these workshops will find great benefit in these workshops.Will I receive any supporting resources if I attend this workshop?Yes! At the conclusion of the workshop, each registered participant will be mailed one complimentary cheat sheet resource for each day of the workshop they registered to attend.  Each Cheat Sheet is strategically designed to support attendees of our workshops when they return back to their campus. If you register multiple participants for both days, you will receive the pair of complimentary cheat sheets for each paid registrant.When should I expect to receive the supporting resources?Participants who fulfill payment for their registration prior to the start of their scheduled workshop can expect their complimentary cheat sheets to be shipped to the shipping address provided at registration within two weeks after the conclusion of the workshop they attended. Participants who register using a purchase order as a promise of payment will need to fulfill the purchase order payment before their complimentary cheat sheets are shipped. Once the purchase order payment is fulfilled, participants can expect their complimentary cheat sheets to be shipped within two weeks of receipt of payment. Will lunch be provided either or both days?We've allotted one hour and 15-minutes for workshop attendees to have lunch on their own. Because most attendees work on a campus with students, they are rarely afforded the opportunity to go to a restaurant for lunch. Our hope is that each attendee takes advantage of this unique opportunity to enjoy a sit-down lunch like most other working professionals are able to do. Throughout both days, beverages such as coffee, water and hot tea will be available to all participants. ‚ÄãIs there a room block available with a special room rate?Yes, please call the hotel directly at (973) 731-7007 and mention Leaving The Village to receive our group rate.Will I be able to receive CEU hours if I attend this workshop?Unfortunately, we can't guarantee that you will be able to receive continuing education units if you attend our workshops. We offer our workshops around the country and we are in the process of ensuring our attendees can earn credits in the future.How can I contact Leaving The Village if I have additional  questions?You can email us at info@leavingthevillage.com or call (301) 789-8407.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/leaving-the-village-30690050998,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/restorative-practices-transforming-traditional-consequences-newark-nj-registration-599936184277,NYC

Designing for Nature: Ecologically Engineering Artificial Coastal Defences,"August 27, 2023, 02:30 PM","August 27, 2023, 03:30 PM","6 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore, 018974, Singapore","This event is part of the Waves of Change Festival 2023 held at ArtScience Museum on the 5th to 27th of August 2023.Designing for Nature: Ecologically Engineering Artificial Coastal DefencesCoastal urbanisation and climate change are driving the global proliferation of artificial coastal defences. These structures have significant effects on the ecology of marine habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. For example, seawalls are generally homogenous and steep. Due to these differences, artificial defences are poor surrogates for the habitats they replace. Ecological engineering‚Äîthe integration of ecological principles and engineering for the benefit of both humans and nature‚Äîis a form of Nature Based Solution that is being increasingly adopted to alleviate the negative impacts associated with coastal defences by improving their ecological functioning. One of the more successful eco-engineering strategies is to add tiles with complex topographies, microhabitats, and water-retaining features. These can increase the richness and abundance of species reminiscent of native communities. Moving forward, how can we incorporate habitat complexity and green elements into new coastal defence designs, and what additional benefits may they be able to provide?About the host: Dr Peter Todd is an experimental marine ecologist who focusses urban marine systems. He works on increasing understanding of the ecology and functioning of tropical coastal marine organisms and communities under environmental stress. His research is multidisciplinary, synthesising elements of biology, geography and engineering to answer ecological questions. His team has 18 years of experience in the conceptualisation, build, implementation, and analysis of novel experiments, and over a decade designing and testing a wide range of seawall enhancements. Dr Todd is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, where he runs the Experimental Marine Ecology Laboratory and is director of the Bachelor of Environmental Studies programme. He has published over 150 peer-reviewed papers on coastal systems and his lab‚Äôs research is featured regularly in both local and international media.

Sustaining Heritage Businesses: Say Tian Hng & Sweetlands Bakery (13 Aug),"August 13, 2023, 11:00 AM","August 13, 2023, 12:30 PM","265C New Bridge Road, Singapore, 088745, Singapore","Qixi Fest, by Bridging Generations Pte Ltd, aims to revive and reimagine Qixi festival celebrations first introduced by our foremothers to Singapore in the 19th century. Our inaugural edition, Qixi Fest 2023, will be held over 7 weekends from 7 July to 20 August. Join us for exciting arts and heritage oriented talks, workshops, exhibitions, and tours leading up to a mega two-day carnival at Smith Street on August 19 and 20!

Or how these businesses can innovate and stay current through the ages?Singapore is home to many heritage businesses, many with decades of history in their respective trades. They may be helmed by craftspeople with unique talents in creating traditional effigies and religious products, or culinary experts passionate about preserving our food heritage. No matter the industry, each heritage business is a precious repository of cultural knowledge. However, many of these businesses find it difficult to survive in modern times, with dwindling sales, higher operating costs, and competition from newer businesses. Join us as we talk to Ng Tze Yong of Say Tian Hng, a traditional effigy workshop, and Nicholas Tan of Sweetlands Bread and Bakery, a traditional bakery. This conversation will be moderated by Chester Matthias Tan, Founder of the Heritage Business Foundation.AÔªøbout the Heritage Business FoundationThe Heritage Business Foundation is a non-profit organisation dedicated to the advancement of heritage through the supporting, networking, and promoting of heritage establishments, as well as the documenting, preserving, and disseminating of heritage material for research, education, and posterity. To that end, the Foundation works directly with a wide variety of heritage businesses and artisans to help them survive and compete in the modern marketplace. By ensuring the sustainability of these businesses, the Foundation aims to ensure the protection and transmission of their cultural heritage.AÔªøbout Say Tian HngSay Tian Hng is a traditional effigy workshop that bears a long, rich history ‚Äì even longer than some of the artefacts present in their shop at 35 Neil Road. Over the years, Say Tian Hng has supplied countless examples of their work to the largest temples and the most modest home altars. They are a family-run business, and multiple generations of their artisans have been plying and passing down this trade since 1896. Today, Say Tian Hng is one of the last remaining Taoist effigy-carving workshops left in Singapore, and is gradually developing new plans to keep the business growing with the times.AÔªøbout Sweetlands Bread and BakeryTucked away on a side street, away from the hustle and bustle of Balestier Road, is Sweetlands Bread and Bakery. Founded in 1960 as Kim Keat Bakery, Sweetlands began by supplying bread to the many coffee shops clustered in the Balestier area. Their ÂçóÊ¥ãÈù¢ÂåÖ (Nanyang bread), a traditional bread loaf first popularised in coffee shops across Singapore, was and continues to be a crowd favourite. From old-school staples like rainbow bread to Western favourites like ciabatta, Sweetlands boasts a diverse range of over fifty different products which they supply to both walk-in customers and F&B businesses alike.",https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/qixi-fest-65328388883,https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/sustaining-heritage-businesses-say-tian-hng-sweetlands-bakery-13-aug-tickets-681522250397,Singapore

They serve as nurseries for young marine life, giving them a safe place to grow. They protect coastal communities from big storms and help stop the land from being washed away. They are also superheroes fighting climate change by storing a lot of carbon. However, coastal development, unsustainable aquaculture and sea-level rise pose unprecedented threats to these fragile ecosystems now.Join us in this sharing about the wonders of mangroves to people in Singapore and what they are doing to protect them.

Designing for Nature: Ecologically Engineering Artificial Coastal Defences,"August 27, 2023, 02:30 PM","August 27, 2023, 03:30 PM","6 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore, 018974, Singapore","This event is part of the Waves of Change Festival 2023 held at ArtScience Museum on the 5th to 27th of August 2023.Designing for Nature: Ecologically Engineering Artificial Coastal DefencesCoastal urbanisation and climate change are driving the global proliferation of artificial coastal defences. These structures have significant effects on the ecology of marine habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. For example, seawalls are generally homogenous and steep. Due to these differences, artificial defences are poor surrogates for the habitats they replace. Ecological engineering‚Äîthe integration of ecological principles and engineering for the benefit of both humans and nature‚Äîis a form of Nature Based Solution that is being increasingly adopted to alleviate the negative impacts associated with coastal defences by improving their ecological functioning. One of the more successful eco-engineering strategies is to add tiles with complex topographies, microhabitats, and water-retaining features. These can increase the richness and abundance of species reminiscent of native communities. Moving forward, how can we incorporate habitat complexity and green elements into new coastal defence designs, and what additional benefits may they be able to provide?About the host: Dr Peter Todd is an experimental marine ecologist who focusses urban marine systems. He works on increasing understanding of the ecology and functioning of tropical coastal marine organisms and communities under environmental stress. His research is multidisciplinary, synthesising elements of biology, geography and engineering to answer ecological questions. His team has 18 years of experience in the conceptualisation, build, implementation, and analysis of novel experiments, and over a decade designing and testing a wide range of seawall enhancements. Dr Todd is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, where he runs the Experimental Marine Ecology Laboratory and is director of the Bachelor of Environmental Studies programme. He has published over 150 peer-reviewed papers on coastal systems and his lab‚Äôs research is featured regularly in both local and international media.

The documentary also follows mining startup The Metals Company, as it pursues funding, public favor, and permission from the International Seabed Authority to mine wide swaths of the Pacific Ocean floor.This screening is followed by a panel discussion organised by Eco-Business, The Deep-Sea Dilemma: Do We Really Need to Dig Up the Ocean Floor to Power the Energy Transition?US$8 trillion worth of precious minerals are scattered on the ocean floor. These minerals are in hot demand to make electric vehicle car batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. Six times the amount of minerals now being mined will be needed to power the energy transition and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. But mining the seabed could come at a significant environmental cost, wrecking the biodiversity of poorly understood ecosystems, ruining fisheries and altering the oxygen-carrying capacity of the ocean. Negotiations are now underway to set the rules for industrial-scale mining of the ocean floor. But do we really need to dig up the ocean floor? What are the alternatives? Our expert panel discusses the deep-sea mining dilemma.Location: ArtScience Cinema, Level 4For the full festival line-up, click HERE!Please note that there are limited seats to all talks.

Forest ‚Äì Beach school @ East,"July 29, 2023, 09:00 AM","July 29, 2023, 12:00 PM","10 Winstedt Road Block A, 02-02, Singapore, 227977, Singapore","A Forest and Beach School in Singapore!
Immerse in a world filled with fisherman boats, fishing villages, colonial houses, lookout towers and a kampong with wildlife!

What is unique about our Forest-Beach School?
Your child gets the best of both worlds to access the forest, sea and beach at Changi and Ubin. Yes, we take boat rides into Pulau Ubin to explore. Most forest schools in Singapore are based at locations where they are more accessible to the trees and greens only.
You receive weekly updates of your child‚Äôs experience at the Forest-Beach School from our forest school teachers who are experienced principals, preschool and secondary school teachers.
Your child can choose what they want to do with the wide variety of materials provided each week. Once they settle down on which direction and where they want to go, we set up a base area. Your child can make their own decision on what to play. We provide yarns, kitchen utensils, watercolours, art materials, drinks and many others. Being child-led with choices empowers your child to be more motivated and focused on their chosen task.
Forest School Philosophy 
The Forest-Beach School approach invites children to develop their inner selves and connect with the outer world. This approach is based on the belief that children learn best when they are allowed to explore and interact with nature, engage in unstructured play and take calculated risks.

During the sessions at Pulau Ubin or Changi Beach, the children of various ages will naturally collaborate, allowing them to learn from one another and build relationships. This approach also encourages children to engage in risky play, which helps them to develop their self-awareness and understand their own capabilities, responsibilities, strength and boundaries. Risky play also fosters children‚Äôs problem-solving skills, as they learn to assess and manage risks.

The nature of the sessions invites children to co-exist with nature. The time spent outdoors helps children develop a sense of appreciation for the natural world and understand the importance of taking care of the environment.

When the children are emotionally connected with mother nature, when they can feel and see the animals, the seawater, the trees and the earth, they are more likely to understand their role in protecting and loving mother nature more.

In Forest-Beach School, children are presented with freedom of movement. The time and space that is offered to children allow children to go inward and focus on their body‚Äôs competency.

Safety forest codes and rules are explained to allow for safe play. We encourage children to trust their bodies, especially during risky play. As leaders hold space for such play, the children develop the necessary thinking process to keep themselves, and their friends safe.

Children will also have plenty of opportunities to develop both language and communication skills as they interact with peers of various age groups.

We engaged Forest School practitioners who are committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for children to explore and build meaning of the world.

This is a collaboration with Hundred Paths, led by Aminah and Sabrina. The sessions are run by qualified leaders.

The sessions are child-led, where children plan and discuss what they would like to do the following week. The final venue on Pulau Ubin, Changi or Pasir Ris Beach depends on the children‚Äôs interests and decisions. We respect and honour their request.

What will my child learn at Forest School? 
The Forest School approach is a child-led approach that believes in the holistic development of children. This approach respects that the child is rich in potential, strong, powerful, competent and confident in building relationships. The sessions provide space for children to remember those qualities in nature. Children will also have plenty of opportunities to develop both language and communication skills as they interact with peers of various age groups. In Forest School, children are presented with freedom of movement. The time and space that is offered to children allow children to go inward and focus on their body‚Äôs competency.

What ‚Äòprogress‚Äô/benefits can I see in my child?
Dr Peter Gray mentioned that ‚ÄúPlay serves the serious purpose of education. The player is playing for fun; education is a by-product.‚Äù A child who plays feels free to take risks and is not afraid of failure because they are not seeking approval from adults. They do know if they fail, there will be no serious real-world consequences. We will also be able to see children gaining confidence in themselves and becoming more resourceful.

They find their own ‚Äòvoices‚Äô and are not afraid to speak up. Children who are accustomed to risky play in nature will also naturally develop their sense of balance. They will also be more coordinated in their gross motor. This physical development can support children‚Äôs ability to be more attentive and engaged in classrooms.

How do the children stay safe in forest school?
The sessions are run by qualified leaders. Safety forest codes and rules are explained to allow for safe play. We encourage children to trust their bodies, especially during risky play. As leaders hold space for such play, the children develop the necessary thinking process to keep themselves, and their friends safe.

Why commit for the long term?
Children present themselves differently just by being in a natural environment. As they adjust their presence in a natural environment, their behaviours adjust. A usual love for nature and the natural environment usually presents itself as the children are constantly being exposed to it. In our long term sessions, one of the primary aims of our initial sessions is to meet the physiological and basic needs of the children first. FS leaders work to ensure that the children become comfortable within that setting.

Site rules are established and children learn their way around the forest. Leaders ensure that safety needs are met and the children understand the risks and rules. For example, the children learn to navigate risk assessments, explore physical boundaries, use the same site (familiarity), tool talks, understand ‚Äòwhatever the weather‚Äô circumstances and have routines.  We observe when they need to run around or when their play is coming to a natural end. This physiological and safety needs usually takes about 5 weeks.

Once these needs have been met, children then develop a sense of belonging and begin to meet their ‚Äòesteem needs‚Äô. This too, is dependent on the needs of individual children. Some require a longer time in order to meet their belonging and esteem needs. At this point, the children will start to recognise the Leaders as facilitators. While having the same children every week creates a sense of belonging and love, they start trusting each other, have fun, there‚Äôs laughter, reflection activities, they share successes
and acceptance. Their sense of belonging occurs after the children‚Äôs physiological and safety needs are met.

As the sense of belonging needs are met, the children then discover their esteem needs. Through social, and physical play in a safe and natural setting, they develop aspects of being human. Having a grounded foundation of esteem needs is something  ‚Äòunteachable.‚Äô A long-term environment like Forest School allows a child to explore having success for himself, not others, learning to self-praise rather than having it externally, has opportunities to repeat things, there is no formal assessment, is child-directed, the child is in control of his learning, he gets to experiment and develop physically. The children‚Äôs esteem needs will actualise when their sense of belonging is actualised.

Long term Forest School has many benefits where a child‚Äôs SPICES (Social, Physical, Intellectual, Communication, Emotional, Spiritual) have room to develop. These can only ever be developed in long-term projects where self-actualization is then achieved.

Wide Age Range
It is our intention to have a wide age gap of children 3.5 ‚Äì 12 years old for the Forest-Beach each school. Children who have the opportunity to work together with children of different age groups and abilities, have cultivate more empathy, kindness, awareness, and understanding of social cues and boundaries. This supports children to be more socio-emotional developed and connected with each other.

Singapore ranks the third highest in bullying globally. It is proven that when children are connected and play together, bullying reduces because children have more empathy and can understand from different perspectives better.

Mindful Space have witness so many beautiful learning moments when children of different age groups come together. The older children learn to role model and polish their leadership skills to problem solve; how to include and motivate people with different pace, perspective and abilities, and empower them to think out of the box. The younger children learn better through observation, and feel the sense of belonging and motivation through the team spirit.

What if my child needs more time for drop off or has separation anxiety?
It is normal for a child to feel anxious during drop-off. We encourage the child to sit with those feelings.  Every feeling is valid. Acknowledge your child‚Äôs feelings. We encourage you to assure your child confidently that you will see him/her again at drop-off.

We highly recommend that parents drop off when their children are ready so the experience is pleasant (and not stressful!) for the child.

The dynamics of the session change and are different when the parents are around.

The good thing is that children tend to explore out of their comfort zone and be more willing and open when their parents are not around (speaking from experience as a group of educators and mothers!). We believe children learn best when they are given a safe space to explore independently.

Children are dropped off at the Changi Point Ferry Terminal. It is a child-led session; hence the children will discuss as a team where and what they would like to do. They have the option to be at Changi Beach or head to Pulau Ubin.

You can sign up for trial sessions to assess whether your child is ready. We understand that some children need more time to be comfortable in a new environment.

For the trial sessions, if your child needs more time to transit to drop-off slowly, parents can observe from a distance, making themselves as invisible as possible, allowing the child to freely interacts with the environment, teachers, or classmates (no interference at all), while the child knows you are around. From the trial sessions (maximum three), we can assess whether the child is ready for drop-off. Most of the time, children surprise parents with their level of adaptability and resilience. When we trust and have confidence in them, they can feel it and trust themselves better too.

The coaches are trained to hold space for children and we would like them to flourish in our sessions. Let us know how we can honour your child‚Äôs needs. We will provide parents with photos and a write-up of the session.

Can I accompany my child to a drop-off session?
We would advise you not to. The dynamics of the group including providing and holding a safe space for children is essential in our sessions. The coaches are trained to hold space for children and we would like them to flourish in our sessions. Special arrangements can be made on a case-to-case basis. Do let us know how we can honour your child‚Äôs needs. We will provide parents with photos and a session write-up in the next few days.

What happens when it rains?
For forest-beach school, we will go ahead even if it‚Äôs raining and seek shelter at respective area if there are lightning. We teach kids how to be resilient and adaptable with the weather, and how to make the best out of things that are beyond our control. We believe that the different elements in nature offers children a range of learning opportunities.

It is very important that children are dressed appropriately for the weather for them to enjoy it. In Forest School we believe that, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing‚Äù. We encourage children to come appropriately attired (a list of recommendations will be given). A raincoat is always handy to have in the child‚Äôs bag.

We will conduct drop-off sessions in a safe, sheltered area nearby the designated site.

Will my child be able to refill their water bottle?
Please arrive at the sessions with the appropriate amount of water your child would need for a 2.5-hour session outdoors. We would recommend a litre water bottle to be with them. Coaches will offer children to refill their water bottles if need be. We ensure that children are well-hydrated during our sessions.

Are there toilet facilities?
There are toilets located at the Mindful Space Changi Studio and Pulau Ubin.

Are there first-aid-trained facilitators?
We will assign at least one first-aid trained coach to the session at all times.

While many examples of modern architecture using MET (Mass Engineered Timber) have appeared in Europe, Canada and the USA in recent years, timber buildings are also attracting attention in Japan. Japan has some of the oldest and largest timber buildings in the world. Until modern times, most buildings in Japan were made of wood. However, when the Building Standards Act was passed in 1950, the height and scale of timber buildings in urban areas was restricted, and since then steel frame and reinforced concrete have been the predominant construction methods. Since late 1980‚Äôs, deregulation and a growing awareness of green building have led to an increasing number of medium and large-scale buildings being constructed in timber. Takenaka Corporation is a leading Japanese design and construction company with a long tradition as a master carpenter. Today, Takenaka is the most advanced timber construction company in Japan and boasts many references. What kind of timber buildings will we, the inheritors of a long tradition of timber architecture, produce in the future, and how will they contribute to the realisation of a carbon-neutral built environment? presenterRÔªøyusuke KojioLicensed/Registered Architect in Japan, Germany, and APEC Adjunct Assistant Professor, Master of Arts in Architectural Conservation, DOA, NUSGeneral Manager, Design and Global Solutions, Takenaka Corporation Asia Regional Headquarters",https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/fcl-global-32450298075,https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/global-seminar-timber-heritage-tickets-675010152537,Singapore

Generating over half of the state‚Äôs greenhouse gases, the transportation sector is a major part of state and local decarbonization goals. At the same time, the state‚Äôs transportation infrastructure is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially increased storm activity and sea level rise. This session shares how the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and BART have recently explored bold changes to their transportation infrastructure and regulation to confront both challenges. SFMTA‚Äôs Climate Roadmap tackles the city‚Äôs ambitious emission and mode share goals through a suite of transformative interventions that draw on international case studies. In addition, their Waterfront Resiliency Transportation Assessment addresses the substantial impact that sea level rise and potential defense strategies will have on the city‚Äôs eastern waterfront and ways to adapt the transportation network to such a reality. BART's Sustainability Action Plan outlines BART's strategy to reduce emissions, optimize energy use, and incorporate climate resilience into districtwide operations. BART also has a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to reduce or eliminate risks to the system from natural disasters, particularly those that would be exacerbated by climate change.The panel will include representatives from the projects discussing the innovative analytical approaches and implementation frameworks leveraged, with lessons that other jurisdictions can utilize for their own climate mitigation and adaptation.

Alligator Lizards in the Air:  Integration Through Creative Expression,"August 26, 2023, 01:00 PM","August 26, 2023, 03:00 PM","2820 Seventh Street, Berkeley, CA 94710","Creative expression is a way to integrate phenomenon and visions experienced in altered states of consciousness, whether they be meditative or entheogenic in nature. From the very first forms of mark-making to the caves of Lascaux to the works of Pablo Amaringo and Alex Grey, humanity has sought to understand our internal landscapes through visual expression. Alligator Lizards in the Air: Healing and Integration through Creative Expression, is a once a month chance to bring these experiences to life through two dimensional mark making.Art mediums from paint to colored pencils, crayons to markers, will be available for everyone to use along with paper and canvas. Krisztina Lazar will be your visionary guide in creativity and will help you realize your experience before your eyes. No art background needed for this class. All you need is an open mind and a willingness to explore. Krisztina Lazar is a visionary artist primarily working in oil paint, watercolor and drawing. She is a Mische Technique lineage holder, a mixture of oil and egg tempera painting invented during the Dutch Renaissance and revolutionized by modern master, Ernst Fuchs. This technique creates an opalescent under painting that the colors are then glazed over, rendering each painting out of light rather than shadow, bringing the images to life with fractal clarity. Utilizing this transformative style that she learned from visionary pioneer, Brigid Marlin, her current body of work explores painting a hybrid of Mische and Alla Prima to render hyperealistic sacred art. With these two techniques combined, Krisztina creates images of Pop Shamanism, portals and visions that speak to today‚Äôs cultural climate of the occult, magic, fantasy, psychedelics, meditation, pop, nostalgia, and the environment movement. Originally from Cleveland, OH, she completed her BFA at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004 and her MFA graduate degree in 2011 at the San Francisco Art Institute New Genres department.  Her paintings have been exhibited in group and solo shows throughout the United States and Europe, most notably at the H.R. Geiger museum in Gruyere, Switzerland. She teaches her unique styles of painting to many students in group and private settings. Her work has been featured in multiple articles, galleries and book publications.  She currently lives and works in Northern California.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-berkeley-alembic-foundation-44559759063,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alligator-lizards-in-the-air-integration-through-creative-expression-tickets-664937023537,SF

Alligator Lizards in the Air:  Integration Through Creative Expression,"August 26, 2023, 01:00 PM","August 26, 2023, 03:00 PM","2820 Seventh Street, Berkeley, CA 94710","Creative expression is a way to integrate phenomenon and visions experienced in altered states of consciousness, whether they be meditative or entheogenic in nature. From the very first forms of mark-making to the caves of Lascaux to the works of Pablo Amaringo and Alex Grey, humanity has sought to understand our internal landscapes through visual expression. Alligator Lizards in the Air: Healing and Integration through Creative Expression, is a once a month chance to bring these experiences to life through two dimensional mark making.Art mediums from paint to colored pencils, crayons to markers, will be available for everyone to use along with paper and canvas. Krisztina Lazar will be your visionary guide in creativity and will help you realize your experience before your eyes. No art background needed for this class. All you need is an open mind and a willingness to explore. Krisztina Lazar is a visionary artist primarily working in oil paint, watercolor and drawing. She is a Mische Technique lineage holder, a mixture of oil and egg tempera painting invented during the Dutch Renaissance and revolutionized by modern master, Ernst Fuchs. This technique creates an opalescent under painting that the colors are then glazed over, rendering each painting out of light rather than shadow, bringing the images to life with fractal clarity. Utilizing this transformative style that she learned from visionary pioneer, Brigid Marlin, her current body of work explores painting a hybrid of Mische and Alla Prima to render hyperealistic sacred art. With these two techniques combined, Krisztina creates images of Pop Shamanism, portals and visions that speak to today‚Äôs cultural climate of the occult, magic, fantasy, psychedelics, meditation, pop, nostalgia, and the environment movement. Originally from Cleveland, OH, she completed her BFA at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004 and her MFA graduate degree in 2011 at the San Francisco Art Institute New Genres department.  Her paintings have been exhibited in group and solo shows throughout the United States and Europe, most notably at the H.R. Geiger museum in Gruyere, Switzerland. She teaches her unique styles of painting to many students in group and private settings. Her work has been featured in multiple articles, galleries and book publications.  She currently lives and works in Northern California.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-berkeley-alembic-foundation-44559759063,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alligator-lizards-in-the-air-integration-through-creative-expression-tickets-664937023537,SF

We aim to empower our customers to create art daily by providing well-designed tools and materials.In 2004, upon graduating from Carleton College, artist and Art Toolkit founder Maria Coryell-Martin embarked on a year-long Watson Fellowship to work alongside climate scientists and researchers around the world. This experience inspired a resolve to continue working as an expeditionary artist and to raise environmental awareness in audiences of all ages.After a memorable experience juggling clumsy sketching tools while crawling in the sand for hours to monitor walruses in Greenland, Maria found she needed a more compact sketching and painting kit. The Art Toolkit and Pocket Palette were born.Today, we create watercolor sketching supplies for urban and wilderness adventures and support a passionate community of artists-beginners and professionals alike. Our unique configurable palettes are available in three sizes, the Demi Palette, Pocket Palette, and Folio Palette. Lightweight and compact, they are perfect for sketching anytime, anywhere. Our namesake, the Art Toolkit, is a rugged all-in-one field art kit stocked with everything a watercolor sketcher might need.

NEDO SV Foresight Seminars: Inventing the Future: Session 7,"August 07, 2023, 05:30 PM","August 07, 2023, 07:30 PM","440 North Wolfe Road, Sunnyvale, CA 94085","NEDO Silicon Valley Foresight Seminars: Inventing the FutureYou are cordially invited to an in-person seminar exploring Innovation in Materials for the Circular Economy. This is the seventh Silicon Valley Foresight Four Seminar Series featuring solutions to advance the goal of a sustainable future with Net Zero emissions by 2050. Innovation in Materials for the Circular EconomyThe goal of the Circular Economy is to solve problems including climate change, pollution and environmental degradation. This can be accomplished by stepping back from the conventional approach for how we make things today to inventing new materials, methods and designs that plan ahead for using non-toxic ingredients to make the products we use every day and to design them so that they can be recovered and reused or deconstructed and reconstructed into new products enabling the materials to be used over and over again, without creating waste.  We will discuss: ‚û¢	What is the circular economy and what are its benefits?‚û¢	Who is innovating in this area and their examples?‚û¢	What are the opportunities for the future of material science?‚û¢	How can we accelerate the transition to circular materials?Additional Information on the Circular Economy:According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation one of the leaders in this field: ‚ÄúIn our current economy, we take materials from the Earth, make products from them, and eventually throw them away as waste ‚Äì the process is linear. In a circular economy, by contrast, we stop waste being produced in the first place. The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design:‚óè	Eliminate waste and pollution‚óè	Circulate products and materials (at their highest value)‚óè	Regenerate natureIt is underpinned by a transition to renewable energy and materials. A circular economy decouples economic activity from the consumption of finite resources. It is a resilient system that is good for business, people and the environment.‚ÄùDate:		Monday, August 7, 2023Time:	   5:30 PM - 7:30 PM (Registration and networking begin at 5:00PM)Location: Plug and Play Tech Center, 440 N Wolfe Rd, Sunnyvale, CA 94085Cost:		Free but registration is requiredYou will have an opportunity to network in person to share your thoughts and experiences with peers and to speak in-depth with each of the panelists after the formal presentation, while enjoying refreshments.Agenda:5:00 - 5:30 PM  -Registration, Networking5:30 - 7:00 PM  -Panel Presentations, Q&A7:00 - 7:30 PM -NetworkingSpeakers/Panelists:	Dr. William Tarpeh, Assistant Professor, Chemical Engineering, and Civil and Environmental Engineering, Center Fellow at the Precourt Institute For Energy, and the Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford UniversityJesse Simons, Co-Founder and CCO, SolarcycleGeoff Chapin, CEO, CarbonwaveMichael Matthews, Commercial Plant Project Manager, Mango Materials

Carbonwave‚Äôs products help reduce and offset emissions from fossil fuels and traditional plastics, while minimizing waste. Their seaweed derived fertilizers and plant performance boosters help soils and crops overcome challenges from environmental stresses like heatwaves, droughts, and soil exhaustion. They are creating a plant-based fabric that relies on the extraction of structural polymers to form films stronger than the seaweed itself and competitive with the strength of other vegan textiles, without relying on polyurethane (PU) plastic for structure and strength. Their SeaBalance line of broad-spectrum emulsifiers have a wide range of applications across cosmetics and skin-care products. Unlike emulsifiers used in cosmetics and personal health that are often made with harmful fossil fuel derivatives, SeaBalance utilizes an all-natural process to make an emulsifier that‚Äôs healthy to use, and healthy for the planet. C-Combinator emulsifiers are versatile by nature: they work with formulations ranging from pH 3.5 to pH 9, and are capable of emulsifying a wide variety of oils between 10% to 40% oil content.Michael Matthews is the Commercial Plant Project Manager for Mango Materials.

He follows a collaborative and dynamic approach to leadership.About Mango Materials: Mango Materials is a renewable bioproducts company dedicated to developing environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional plastics and polyesters by fermenting and transforming waste methane to produce biopolymers which are then used to create biodegradable products. Mango Materials transforms waste gas streams into affordable, biodegradable materials while creating a positive environmental impact. It produces  naturally occurring biopolymers from waste biogas (methane) that are economically competitive with conventional oil-based materials.They are currently focused on producing Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) which are a potential replacement for some petrochemical-based plastics. They are producing PHA from waste methane gas at a San Francisco Bay Area wastewater treatment plant. PHA is  a family of biopolyesters that can be produced naturally by bacteria and other life forms. PHB is one of the many types of PHA. Unlike PLA and other biopolymers, PHA can biodegrade in many environments, including the oceans. YOPP pellets can be used in injection molding, fiber extrusion, additive manufacturing, and other plastic substitute applications. YOPP and YOPP+ pellets are optimally-formulated for fibers (for apparel and textiles) and rigid goods (for jars, caps, and molded applications). (YOPP is a trade name that stands for ‚ÄúYou Oust Polluting Plastics‚Äù.)

SF: Food + History + Art Tour,"July 30, 2023, 12:00 PM","July 30, 2023, 03:00 PM","16th and Church Street, San Francisco, CA 94114","What makes the SF: Food + History + Art tour different from other SF food tours?Food: The Mission District is renowned for having some of the best food in San Francisco. From the Chinese in the 1850's, to Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, to successive waves of migration from India, Vietnam and Thailand in the last fifty years, each culture has left its mark on the culinary landscape of SF. And we haven‚Äôt even mentioned Latin America or Japan yet! Although the Mission District is known for being at the epicenter of Latino culture in the city, its food scene is in fact very varied - and very good.History: San Francisco has a fascinating story too. We start the tour at the Misi√≥n San Francisco de As√≠s, which is the birthplace of modern SF. We'll give you an overview of the city's history, from the dog days of the Spanish Empire, to being part of Mexico, to the Gold Rush era, through the Great Fire and up to today, as the city transforms once again. You'll have a chance to learn all about it.Art: We have some amazing art in the city (especially if you think of the world class museums in the Bay Area), but the Mission District is arguably the best neighborhood for public murals. We'll visit the Clarion Alley Mural Project, as well as enjoying amazing street art like the Women's Building. It's also a great way to get a better understanding of this often complicated - and sometimes misunderstood - city.Join us on our SF food tour and TRULY experience the best of San Francisco.Our tours can sell out.

Burnt by Clare Frank at Napa County Library,"September 05, 2023, 06:00 PM","September 05, 2023, 07:00 PM","580 Coombs St., Napa, CA 94559","ABOUT THIS BOOK:When Clare Frank was 17 years old, she became a firefighter in Northern California. Clare was five foot two and too young to officially join the service‚Äîshe left her birthdate blank on her paperwork, hoping no one would notice. And she didn‚Äôt look like her peers, who sported an Adam‚Äôs apple and a mustache. But her brother was a firefighter and loved it, so she thought she‚Äôd try it out, too. Very soon, she knew she‚Äôd found her calling.Burnt: A Memoir of Fighting Fire  is Clare‚Äôs inspiring, richly detailed, and open-hearted account of an extraordinary life in fire. It chronicles the transformation of a young adult determined to prove her mettle into a scarred and sensitive veteran, grappling with the weight of her duties as Chief of Fire Prevention‚Äîone of the highest-ranking women in Cal Fire history‚Äîwhile record-setting fires engulf her home state. Mentors and managing, funerals and scandal, pickup basketball, car crashes, and always fire‚Äîno one has written about this world, from this perspective, like Clare Frank. She masterfully mixes irreverence and awe, taking readers inside station houses, on daily calls, and along on wildfire campaigns where antics and dark humor balance terrifying risk, trauma, and a sense of almost holy responsibility. Burnt is an unforgettable memoir from an American original.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Clare Frank started firefighting in California at 17 and was promoted up the ranks, becoming the state‚Äôs first and only female Chief of Fire Protection. Along the way, she earned a BS in fire administration, an MFA in creative writing, and a JD. She has lectured at colleges, universities, and state and national fire conferences, and lives near Lake Tahoe with her husband and two dogs. This is her first book.PRAISE FOR BURNT:‚ÄúA¬†vigorous and quite timely memoir¬†. . .¬†Throughout the book, Frank is¬†energetic and inspirational, especially to women considering work in the field.‚Äù ‚ÄîKirkus Reviews‚ÄúGood memoirs can introduce intriguing individuals and provide access to rarefied pursuits. Author Frank manages both. . . The action scenes are compelling; there are hardwon victories and excruciating losses, and Frank emerges as a relatable and thoroughly human hero.‚Äù			   ‚ÄîBooklist‚ÄúIn this evocative account of life in the firehouse, Clare Frank portrays the risks firefighters face and the stakes that are now higher than they‚Äôve ever been. She does so with grit and a healthy sense of humor. A must-read.‚Äù ‚ÄîErin Brockovich‚ÄúOminous orange skies and smoke-choked cities:¬†The¬†wildfire crisis is here.¬†Burnt¬†takes you inside. From dirt firefighter to leading thousands, Clare Frank offers a real,¬†humorous, one-of-a-kind¬†front-row¬†seat to wildfires and those who fight them.‚Äù ‚ÄîCaroline Godkin, Executive Director of the Climate and Wildfire Institute",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/napa-bookmine-17833336597,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/burnt-by-clare-frank-at-napa-county-library-tickets-669618556127,SF

Weed‚Äôem Out: Native Restoration @ Cascade Creek with Pie Ranch and AMLT,"August 12, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 12, 2023, 02:30 PM","3100 Cabrillo Highway, Pescadero, CA 94060","Join Pie Ranch and the Amah Mutsun Land Trust to remove invasive species from Cascade Creek!9:30am - 2:30pm Volunteer work Session12pm - 1pm Lunch providedVolunteers are needed to help to remove invasive plants in a critical section of the creek. We especially need help removing eucalyptus sprouts from around the creek. Lunch will be served to volunteers between sessions. Spend time outdoors, meet new people, learn about invasive plants and creek habitat, and help restore the ancestral land of the Quiroste Tribe (represented by the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band and Land Trust).Due to the rough terrain, this event is best suited for participants age 16 years and older.When you arrive at Cascade Ranch, meet Pie Ranch and AMLT staff in the parking area next to the first white barn or, if late, follow on foot the event signs from the parking lot to the area of the creek we will be working on. Previous experience is not necessary. We will teach you how to identify the target species and how to remove and process them.Be aware that the areas in which we will be working may contain poison oak, blackberries and other prickly plants like thistle and stinging nettle. Please do your best to arrive on time so that we can all move to the creek area together!What to bring:Work glovesWater bottleHatSunscreenBackpackSturdy work boots or shoesSnacks or personal lunch if preferredLots of energy and a desire to weed out invasive species!Riparian (creekside) restoration is nowadays more important than ever. Indeed, healthy riparian ecosystems promote ecological and climate resilience both within and beyond riparian zones, lead to the accrual and sequestration of carbon and nitrogen in soil, absorb heat and buffer organisms against extreme temperatures. Cascade Ranch is within an area of high biological richness and surrounded by California protected areas. About 1.2 miles of Cascade Creek fall within the boundaries of the property, which is currently managed by the non-profit Pie Ranch. Cascade Creek represents an important habitat connectivity area for a wide array of plants and animals and a potential traditional food source for people. Unfortunately, the riparian zone has been highly affected by the spreading of invasive plant species, which are causing loss of biodiversity and related ecosystem services and products. The 2020 CZU complex fire has further contributed to the increase in number, variety and spread of invasive species along Cascade Creek.Your hard work and participation will help shape the future of this land!

Leading Transportation Agencies through Climate Mitigation and Adaptation,"August 09, 2023, 05:30 PM","August 09, 2023, 07:00 PM","Pier 1 The Embarcadero Bayside Room, San Francisco, CA 94105","Leading Transportation Agencies through Climate Mitigation and AdaptationCalifornia‚Äôs transportation system sits squarely at the crossroads of climate mitigation and adaptation. Generating over half of the state‚Äôs greenhouse gases, the transportation sector is a major part of state and local decarbonization goals. At the same time, the state‚Äôs transportation infrastructure is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially increased storm activity and sea level rise. This session shares how the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and BART have recently explored bold changes to their transportation infrastructure and regulation to confront both challenges. SFMTA‚Äôs Climate Roadmap tackles the city‚Äôs ambitious emission and mode share goals through a suite of transformative interventions that draw on international case studies. In addition, their Waterfront Resiliency Transportation Assessment addresses the substantial impact that sea level rise and potential defense strategies will have on the city‚Äôs eastern waterfront and ways to adapt the transportation network to such a reality. BART's Sustainability Action Plan outlines BART's strategy to reduce emissions, optimize energy use, and incorporate climate resilience into districtwide operations. BART also has a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to reduce or eliminate risks to the system from natural disasters, particularly those that would be exacerbated by climate change.The panel will include representatives from the projects discussing the innovative analytical approaches and implementation frameworks leveraged, with lessons that other jurisdictions can utilize for their own climate mitigation and adaptation. The session will include a moderated discussion and Q&A to engage with the audience.Program ParticipantsModerators: 	Taylor McAdam, Senior Transportation Planner, Fehr & Peers Panelists: 	 Tim Doherty, Policy and Long-Range Planning Team Lead - San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency  (SFMTA)Matt  Goyne, Principal - Fehr & Peers Michael Cox,  Principal Sustainability Analyst - San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)When:	Wednesday August 9th, 5:30 -7:30pmWhere:	Port of San Francisco, Pier 1 The Embarcadero, Bayside Room, San Francisco, CA, 94105Cost:		$60 WTS Members / $80 Non-Members / $10 Students or UnemployedFood:		Buffet style dinner & drinks will be providedRSVP:	Please RSVP by August 4 via Eventbrite HereÔªøFor questions, please email us at ProgramsWTSSanFrancisco@gmail.comEmpowering Women, Transforming Transportation.

Sustainable Gardening Series: Fall 2023,"October 21, 2023, 10:00 AM","November 04, 2023, 12:00 PM","1590 7th Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94122"," Introduction to Sustainable Gardening Series - Fall 2023October 21st, 28th, and November 4th - Saturdays from 10am to 12pm. Cost: $30 for the full three-part series, and receive a $10 gift card at each workshop. Sponsored by the San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionThe Introduction to Sustainable Gardening series is a three-part workshop series designed to help you transform your yard into a thriving, sustainable garden. This course will teach you everything you need to know to nurture perennial gardens that conserve water, provide beauty, and attract pollinators and beneficial insects.San Francisco is a beautiful and unique city, with year-round mild temperatures and dry, foggy summers. Learn what plants are adapted to our coastal climate and grow without the need for toxic pesticides or large amounts of water. This course will focus on native and drought-tolerant ornamental gardens but will cover broad topics that can also apply to vegetable gardening.The full series is $30, but you will get $10 gift cards to the¬†Urban Farmer Store¬†at each workshop (for a total of $30 in gift cards if you attend the two workshops).Registering will sign you up for the full series of three workshops. Please only register if you plan to attend all three sessions. SERIES SUMMARY: Part I: Sustainable Garden Design  This workshop will teach you how to design a beautiful, functional, and thriving home garden space. San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco‚Äôs dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill.¬†Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides. Ellyn will discuss the notion that most plant health problems are caused by poor growing conditions or improper planting, and that pests and diseases may be secondary problems. Plant health care involves a combination of strategies including monitoring, and you'll learn strategies to attract beneficial insects, and keep pests, diseases, and weeds at bay naturally. Instructor Ellyn Shea is a Bay Area gardener, garden coach, Certified Arborist, consultant, and educator. She is a longtime Garden for the Environment teacher and supporter and shares her extensive gardening knowledge in this workshop series.

Materevolve hosts: Textile  X  Ocean Connector Sail 2023,"October 13, 2023, 12:30 PM","October 13, 2023, 06:30 PM","2100 Bridgeway, Sausalito, CA 94965","Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyPROGRAM DESCRIPTIONThe 2023 Textile X Ocean Connector Sail will build off of last year's inaugural Textile X Ocean Connector Sail, bringing new experts together to talk about the most current research and solutions. Our programming is designed to encourage deep connections between attendees and help answer hard questions about textile-derived ocean pollution (i.e. microfiber pollution), climate change, textile waste, green chemistry, ocean-thoughtful material alternatives, and more.  This year's Textile X Ocean Connector Sail will be 5 hours - allowing time for educational programming, connecting deeply, and putting up the sails to enjoy some sailing! Participants will have the option to assist with sailing, or we welcome you to sit and enjoy the view. The longer sail will allow us to spend more time outside of the Golden Gate Bridge and see more of the San Francisco Bay! Educational activities include demonstrations of marine research techniques and participation in ""Educational Tastings"" - a series of short expert presentations that inspire conversation and discussion. Our tastings are facilitated by leaders at the intersection of Textile X Ocean with diverse backgrounds and a passion for knowledge-sharing.On board, you will learn how microfiber pollution is measured, what we know about the potential sources and pathways for fiber pollution in our region, discuss solutions at the forefront of our Textile X Ocean community, and upcoming ways to get involved in furthering research and solutions.Lisa Erdle, 5 Gyres Director of Science and Innovation joined the 2022 sail to help lead a demonstration on techniques to monitor microfiber pollution in water bodies. Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyTARGET ATTENDEES:Target participants include a cross-sector group of textile industry experts, textile company representatives, scientists, policy makers, representatives from universities and environmental groups, students, young professionals, and other interested stakeholders. Please feel free to share this invitation with your colleagues or other interested parties that may like to join.A range of stakeholders from industry, brands, research entities, and environmental non-profits joined the 2022 sail with many new partnerships and relationships formed. Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyABOUT THE ORGANIZERSTogether, Krystle Moody Wood and Carolynn Box have established themselves as some of the world's leading experts in microfiber pollution- an issue easily recognized at the intersection of oceans and textiles. With Krystle's background in materials innovation and sustainable textile systems, and Carolynn's background in ocean conservation and plastic pollution, this program merges both of their worlds and expertise.  From hosting an 85 person workshop with NOAA's Marine Debris Program in 2020 and co-authoring the ""California Microfiber Update: Textile Perspective"" to recently co-authoring a congressional report, The Report on Microfiber Pollution, with the EPA Trash Free Waters Program and NOAA's Marine Debris Program on behalf of the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC), Krystle and Carolynn have been able to bring together key learnings from science, industry, government and academia to improve communication cross-discipline and advance toward solutions. In May 2021, Carolynn and Krystle hosted an experiential sail program with local non-profit Fibershed on ""Building Regional Textile Systems For Healthy Soils and Healthy Seas"" on the Call of the Sea's Matthew Turner.  The success of this program was featured in the special Marine Pollution issue of ECO Magazine in October of 2021.From 2021-2022, Carolynn and Krystle served as advisors for the Conservation X Labs Microfiber Innovation Challenge supporting transformative innovations targeting microfiber pollution upstream within the textile industry. IÔªøn October 2022, Carolynn and Krystle hosted the inaugural Textile X Ocean Connector sail that brought together 65 participants from more than 35 organizations to participate in a thoughtfully curated program that educated participants and  encouraged collaboration to work towards solutions.  We are honored that our attendees wanted to see us make the Textile X Ocean Connector Sail an annual event!Both Krystle and Carolynn have served on the San Francisco Bay Microplastics Working Group for many years and are active in the ocean conservation space- continuing to find links where they can use their superpowers in connecting passionate people, providing educational opportunities, and fostering creative collaborations to support the development of a blue material world. Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyCarlie Herring, a research scientist at NOAA Marine Debris Program and co-author of the SOS 2.0 Report on Microfiber Pollution, is providing guests with an overview of the upcoming congressional report to spark discussion with attendees about federal action and policy.  Image credit: Paige Green PhotographySURVEY:Known for thoughtful curation of experience, education, and solutions-focused resources for cross sector groups, we have developed this short survey to build off of what we learned last year.  Our goal is to have survey results from all ticketed attendees (as well as those that are interested) to refine our programming and what you will take home with you.  We also have a limited number of scholarship tickets available for those where finances are a barrier.  Please follow this link and fill out ASAP.

San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco‚Äôs dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill.¬†Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides.

But when a mechanical mishap sends the two traveling back through time, they'll have to work as a team to return to the present day.In order for the time machine to send them back, the unlikely duo must gather data on recycling throughout the ages - from sustainable marketplaces in Edo Japan to garbage-gobbling pigs in 19th-century NYC. Yet the closer the team gets to the present day, the more that plastic presents a problem: they're running out of time.Harnessing their frustration over the daunting ecological future they've inherited, Charlie and Oliver discover the ways in which they can use their sustainability knowledge to return home and build a better earth.In this sweeping educational adventure that transports readers across continents and centuries, Washington Post contributor Katie Wheeler invites readers into the history of recycling and how students can reduce plastic waste. Wheeler's fresh journal-style graphic novel acknowledges the reality of plastic pollution while offering accessible activist solutions, playfully-illustrated sustainability tips, and an optimistic look into how modern scientists are combating waste. Books for a Better Earth are designed to inspire children to become active, knowledgeable participants in caring for the planet they live on.OÔªørder Team TrashThis event is free to attend, though registration is required through the link provided.

Valley Growing Gardens is a family-grown urban Food Scaped Oasis in the  middle of beautiful downtown Puyallup. Years ago, the Cowan family decided that self-sufficiency and the ability to grow their own food was paramount to a truly healthy way of life. They began to learn everything they could about the principles of Permaculture and endeavored to build their Food Forest/Urban Farm. As a family, they designed these gardens as a study in efficiency and sustainability, limited only by the size of their city lot. Every year, the family rethinks their gardens and dreams up ways to incorporate and grow additional varieties with greater volumes of food plants. Valley Growing Gardens is all Organic and has not sprayed or been treated for any pests or diseases since its inception. They continue to work with Nature to encourage a wholesome balance in Harmony with the earth. The family wants to encourage people to listen to Nature and build gardens for the future in an Earth-Friendly and Sustainable way. We develop and produce our own compost. We will be teaching and helping others to garden/farm regeneratively by bringing life back into our soils. Without good healthy soil, there will be no food! Mother Earth is sending out an S.O.S and we want to help. We can help you learn how to garden regeneratively and how to help to sequester more carbon into the soil. Life is soil and soil is Life. The most important take-away from this humble valley garden is that no matter whether you live on acres of land or in a small apartment, you can grow good, Organic Food. In this class you will tour the gardens and be thought the principles of growing organically while working with nature.

How do we navigate this new age of extremes? In A Traveler's Guide to the End of the World, David Gessner takes readers on an eye-opening tour of climate hotspots from the Gulf of Mexico to the burning American West to New York City to the fragile Outer Banks, where homes are being swallowed by the seas. He does so with his usual sense of humor, compassion, and a willingness to talk to anyone, providing an informative and sobering yet convivial guide for the age of fire, heat, wind, and water.Gessner approaches scientists and thinkers with a father's question: What will the world be like in forty-two years? Gessner was forty-two when his daughter, Hadley, was born. What will the world be like in 2064, when Hadley is his age now? What is the future of weather? The future of heat, storms, and fire? What exactly will our children be facing? A Traveler's Guide to the End of the World tells a story of climate crisis that will both entertain and shake people awake to the necessity of navigating this new age together.David Gessner is the author of Quiet Desperation, Savage Delight: Sheltering with Thoreau in the Age of Crisis, Leave It As It Is: A Journey Through Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs American Wilderness, and the New York Times‚Äìbestselling All the Wild That Remains: Edward Abbey, Wallace Stegner and the American West.

Qumsiyeh published over 170 scientific papers, over 30 book chapters, hundreds of articles, and several books on topics ranging from cultural heritage to human rights to biodiversity conservation to cancer. He oversaw a number of projects ranging from formulating the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan to empowerment projects with farmers, women, and children that benefitted tens of thousands. He is laureate of the Paul K.¬†Feyerabend Foundation award¬†the¬†Takreem award¬†among others.

Our earth faces climate change, habitat destruction, pollution, invasive species, overexploitation, rampant inequality, and wars/conflict. How are we to ensure sustainable human and natural communities against all odds? Palestine is the Western part of the Fertile Crescent where humans first developed agriculture. This is why this part of Western Asia was the cradle of civilizations and monotheistic religions. Can this geographic spot generate modules of sustainability in the bleakest of conditions? Can these models be applicable to other countries? These and other questions are addressed.Qumsiyeh is accompanied by his wife Jessie Chang, a co-founder and co-director and volunteer director at the institute. Both donated their money and are full time volunteers at the institute.

About the Alnoba Peace Foundation
A world in need of healing
From climate change to the impact of technology on our minds and the economy, our world is in crisis. A winner-take-all society isolates us from each other and from the earth that sustains us. Our communities are broken, consumption and waste run rampant, and we are severed from the healing power of the natural world.
Both we and the world need a change. Start that change on the inside. You can overcome the harmful and destructive patterns imposed on you by this broken world we‚Äôre living in, opening to a more natural and authentic way of engaging with yourself and our planet.
The power to change
There are both ancient and pioneering tools you can use to rewrite your patterns, breaking free of the old way of thinking and being as you tap into something stronger: a way of living that connects us harmoniously to both each other and the earth we share.
Manny Muros has spent decades studying, practicing and sharing the spiritual techniques that lead to greater self-awareness and self-realization. His wisdom teachings are insights gained through a lifetime of deep practice and exploration. Through meditation and affirmative practices, he teaches students how to center, deconstruct old patterns and recover a truer way of being.
The sacred land of Alnoba, with its pristine fields and forests and inspiring collection of outdoor art, serves as a potent space for undertaking this journey of transformation.
Be the difference
To use the ancient words of wisdom: as it is above, so it is below. The world we cultivate inside ourselves makes a real impact on the one that surrounds us. By changing one, we impact the other.
Step forward into your own change, breaking free of a paradigm that destroys both our well-being and that of our planet. Discover a healthier, more authentic alternative that empowers you to be the change you seek.

Our earth faces climate change, habitat destruction, pollution, invasive species, overexploitation, rampant inequality, and wars/conflict. How are we to ensure sustainable human and natural communities against all odds? Palestine is the Western part of the Fertile Crescent where humans first developed agriculture. This is why this part of Western Asia was the cradle of civilizations and monotheistic religions. Can this geographic spot generate modules of sustainability in the bleakest of conditions? Can these models be applicable to other countries? These and other questions are addressed.Qumsiyeh is accompanied by his wife Jessie Chang, a co-founder and co-director and volunteer director at the institute. Both donated their money and are full time volunteers at the institute. The event helps to raise awareness and garner support of all types (money, expertise, networking, volunteers etc) to our institute and environmental/sustainability work in Palestine.Please register for this FREE program.

Halinski, Principal, Client Services Consultant/Associate PM, MSD, Broadcom, Inc.People of vastly different backgrounds, nationalities, orientations, and identities create open-source software, hardware, and standards. This is an excellent example of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Studies reveal that diversity in participation produces better outcomes and more robust technologies.The use of Open Source software and APIs helps users and administrators of databases gain significant value in analyzing the functionality and performance of their specific database products. This is also an excellent avenue to help modernize the Mainframe.The establishment of a connection to a database via a REST API (with optional Open Source ZOWE features) and combining it with an Open Source time-series database coupled with a dashboard visualization package, creates an ‚ÄúEmbrace Open‚Äù. This Embrace Open enables users to view system and/or performance data, enables users to implement and automate warnings and recommendations to avoid system risks, and provides flexibility to leverage modern, user-friendly tooling to improve the user experience.In this presentation, we‚Äôll take a look at implementation techniques to satisfy a performance monitoring use case, using open-source tools to visualize performance metrics produced by an API. Our example will be based on the Zowe API for an IDMS database, but these techniques are general and can be applied to any database product (e.g. Db2/IMS/Datacom) that reveals performance metrics through a REST API.Performance Engineering for HumanityMohit Verma, Performance Engineering Evangelist‚ÄúPerformance Engineering for Humanity‚Äù is a captivating presentation that explores the intersection of technology and human-centric design.

Panel Topic: Mining Data Centres as an Economic DriverSynopsis: Successful Bitcoin mining hubs have discovered that the benefits of the industry extend beyond the establishment of profitable companies. In regions like Texas, mining firms have rejuvenated post-industrial towns, created high-value jobs and educational programs, and supported the development of important infrastructure and civic services, ranging from roads to community centres. Join this expert panel to learn why miners have a vested interest in long-term relationships, and how the ecosystems of blockchain companies that form around them can help transform municipalities into innovation hubs.

In Quebec, mining data centres can play an important role in making renewables more profitable, increasing the sustainability of agriculture, and supporting the growth of disruptive digital companies that will benefit the province‚Äôs global competitiveness. In other parts of the world, mining has been an accelerant for green infrastructure development and a valuable revenue source for electricity grids due to its flexibility as a power consumer.
