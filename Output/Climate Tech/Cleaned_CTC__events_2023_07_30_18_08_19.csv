The Women's Convention 2023,"October 20, 2023, 03:00 PM","October 22, 2023, 01:00 PM","400 West Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53203","We’re at an inflection point in our country. What we do in the next five years will impact the next five decades. If we are going to protect our personal rights, our communities, and democracy itself, we need to build the biggest movement possible. We need to consolidate women and allies around shared values, experience, and culture to build a nation that works for all of us. The 2023 Women’s Convention will provide a space for you to rejuvenate and find connection and support. Whether you are brand new to social change work or a veteran activist, this space is built for you.  You will gain tools, make connections, and experience the feminist future we want to live in. While Women’s March is a key vehicle for the new power of everyday women, our Women’s Convention connects you to the network of the movement and equips you with the skills, training, and opportunities you’ll need to become change agents in your own communities.  Learn more: www.thewomensconvention.com FAQsWhat is the Women's Convention?The Women’s Convention is a weekend of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums, creative expression, and intersectional movement building. It will be a place where cause, community, and creativity intersect. We will provide a space where people can meet, share common interests, and engage on issues of civic engagement, accelerated by pop culture. We will engage activists by melding traditional organizing programming with non-traditional programming, including salons, art spaces, screenings, social programming, and women’s workforce development. This convention will leverage the power of culture shift through skilling up and storytelling to create an empowered space of feminist momentum. This event will mobilize and unite movements for gender justice, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, and environmental justice and bring thousands of participants to combine activism and creative expression among everyday people. When and where is it? The Women’s Convention will run from Friday, October 20, to Sunday, October 22, 2023. The location is the Baird Center in Milwaukee, WI. Visit  www.thewomensconvention.com  to learn more about transportation, lodging, and to find our feminist guide to visiting Milwaukee.How much does it cost?General admission is $350 per person—an amount that covers the full cost of entrance to the Women's Convention. If your employer is paying for your registration, we ask that you please register at the institutional level, $555 per person.

If you're interested in getting more information about scholarships, please click here.Why Wisconsin? We’re continuing to build on the success of the 2022 Women’s Convention by hosting it in Wisconsin for 2023 & 2024. Wisconsin is a vitally important state in 2024. Referred to as the incubator for our country’s tribal politics, many pundits think that Wisconsin is one of the states that will be both a deciding factor in the 2024 Presidential election and one that demonstrates the deep polarization that characterizes U.S. politics. With strong organizing, Wisconsin is flippable and Women’s March has the ability to make an impact on the outcome of the election. Women’s March has been making strategic interventions in Wisconsin since 2022, through both mobilizations and electoral strategies. The Women’s Convention will continue that investment with those women and communities who are the backbone and future of Wisconsin. We know that Women’s March belongs to our marchers and that they are the ones that make a change in whatever place they call home. We can support, connect, and amplify what they are doing and can do in their own backyards.Who will be there?The Women’s Convention will bring together over a thousand everyday women activists, allies, movement leaders, rising political stars that reflect our nation’s changing demographics, and thousands of new grassroots leaders who’ve organized in their communities and taken to the streets since January 2017. We hope to make this one of the largest convenings of its kind, and a unique opportunity for everyday women and our allies—from all backgrounds, and experiences—to learn together, share expertise, and unite around collective goals and strategies.What is the program? What can attendees expect? We are developing a program of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums, and intersectional movement building based on the input, ideas, and efforts of organizers from our grassroots movements. Attendees—regardless of prior experience—can expect to be inspired, challenged, connected, and educated. The goal of the Women’s Convention is for participants to leave inspired and motivated, with new connections, skills, and strategies for working towards a collective feminist future. Visit www.thewomensconvention.com  for up-to-date programming information. Want to submit a workshop or idea for consideration? Visit www.thewomensconvention.com Where can I stay?Women's March has negotiated a limited amount of discounted room rates at the Hilton and Doubletree Hotels, both across the street from the convention center.

See Eventbrite's troubleshooting FAQ here.Tickets:This event is free to attend. Registration is required in advance.About Set Adrift. . .In January, 1958, a renowned sailing family was lost in a storm in the Bermuda Triangle. The youngest of two daughters, Sarah, suddenly an orphan, grew up never knowing her parents and grandparents. As an adult, she began to pursue the mystery of her family and their disappearance, and discovered that their stories were far different from the versions she was told. Sarah Conover’s memoir follows the national media’s investigation of the Revonoc’s vanishing, and exposes the truths that led her to “unstory” the family history, creating a new understanding of their lives, and hers.About Interrogating Travel. . .Never in human history has travel been so accessible to so many. But—amid an escalating climate crisis that threatens the homes of vulnerable people across the world—has the human cost of trekking the globe become too high? Paul Lindholdt links firsthand narratives with research about the travel trade, telling stories of his reluctant voyages while arguing that carbon-intensive trips abroad may be offset if adventurers come to know and love the landscapes closer to home. Tourism may be the planet’s largest industry, but Interrogating Travel advises readers to stay mindful of the consequences of their journeys, whether visiting local getaways or some of Earth’s most remote locations.Sarah Conover holds a BA in religious studies from the University of Colorado and an MFA in Creative Writing from Eastern Washington University. Her poetry, essays and interviews have been published in a variety of literary journals and anthologies including The Sun Magazine, and she is a feature writer and columnist for Tricycle Magazine: The Buddhist Review. She is an award-winning author of six books on world wisdom traditions and spirituality. A recipient of a Washington GAP Grant (Grants for Artists’ Projects), she has also received fellowships from the Ucross Foundation and the Willapa Bay Artist in Residence program. Her memoir, Set Adrift: My Family’s Disappearance in the Bermuda Triangle, a Mystery and a Memoir, will be released in June by 55 Fathoms Press. The History Channel, with a team of scientists and divers, is creating an episode of their Into the Bermuda Triangle series exploring the Conover family tragedy and aiming to find her family’s sunken yacht.Paul Lindholdt, Professor of English and Philosophy at Eastern Washington University, teaches literature and environmental humanities. Coming of age in Seattle and on Vashon Island, he studied in Bellingham at Fairhaven College under Annie Dillard and is working on a biography of her. He has published some 200 books, chapters, journal articles, essays, columns, reviews, and poems and serves several environmental organizations. Besides recognition from the Academy of American Poets and the Society of Professional Journalists, he won a Washington State Book Award in 2012 for In Earshot of Water.

Naked =Nudity is mandatory, but we make accommodations for accessibility. For example, we recognize that people need different tools for managing menstruation. Having your period doesn’t necessitate wearing bottoms though; it’s okay if your tampon string shows, or you leak a bit on your mat & towel. Participants may opt to use items such as binders, bottoms, or prosthetics to manage trauma or gender dysphoria. The goal of being Naked! is to practice self-compassion and body acceptance, which requires experiencing bodies as they are, and this can be challenging for many people. The purpose of accommodations is not to avoid this challenge, but to remove obstacles which prevent engaging with it.As with comments about others' appearance, we do not allow comments on others' accommodations. If you have a concern, ask us privately. These examples are not an exhaustive list, so if you need accommodation, just talk to us.Please bring a valid photo I.D. for age verification. Everyone MUST be an active, willing participant and at least 18 years old.Logistics:YOU MUST BRING YOUR OWN MAT (and we recommend a towel).

Do not knock or disrupt class in an attempt to gain late entry.NOTE: Unfortunately, Aether is not currently wheelchair-accessible. After entering the main door, there is a short set of stairs required to access the studio. We apologize for this and are always on the lookout to rent wheelchair-accessible spaces in the future.

There is paid metered parking along all the side streets, and multiple all-day parking lots right by the studio. There are no events scheduled at Climate Pledge Arena that night, so the area shouldn't be too hard to navigate.The front door of the building will be locked; someone will be there to let you in and guide you down the hall to the studio.

If you have a concern, ask us privately. These examples are not an exhaustive list, so if you need accommodation, just talk to us.Everyone MUST be an active, willing participant and at least 18 years old.Consent: All physical contact must be consensual. We’ll provide a system for silently opting-out of adjustments during class. If you opt-in to adjustments, the instructors will ask for verbal consent before offering touch corrections. You can change your mind at any time, and any answer is acceptable, so know your boundaries. Anything less than an enthusiastic “yes” means “no.” Our consent policy applies to all situations, including physical contact that may seem appropriate in a clothed setting (e.g. hugs, moving through a crowd), so ask for permission before touching anyone before, during, and after class, even while clothed.No Cruising: Please abide by the desexualized atmosphere of our classes. Don’t ask to meet up with people outside of class. Nudity is not an invitation for personal advances. Also, please do not make any comments about anyone’s appearance (e.g., “You have a nice body,” “Your hair is pretty”). We’ll prioritize the experience of the recipient over the intention of a “compliment”, so err on the side of caution! This applies to live events & online platforms (e.g. Meetup, Patreon).Be Respectful: We welcome all adults who abide by our rules and treat others with respect. Body-shaming or hateful comments of any kind will not be tolerated. Be aware of your gaze: it’s okay to look around if you get lost during the movement, but take care not to stare or focus intently on others.Cell Phones: Cell phones are strictly prohibited while clothes are off, including after class, so please silence them and put them away. If you need to use your phone while anyone is Naked!, please put on clothes and exit the studio. The Erection Question: Signs of arousal such as erections are physiological responses that are as involuntary as sweating. If you experience observable arousal during movement class, just ignore it, or take Child’s Pose if you prefer. If you exhibit signs of arousal while socializing after class, please put on clothing for the comfort of some participants.No Latecomers:  Everyone is expected to be on time to hear the rules (even if you've heard them before). The instructor is permitted to close the entrance five minutes beyond the scheduled start time. Once clothes are off, no further entry will be permitted, NO EXCEPTIONS, and we don't refund latecomers. Please do not knock or disrupt class in an attempt to gain late entry.No Lingering: Following the conclusion of class, please exit the premises in a reasonable amount of time as directed by the instructor. Do not wait to be alone with an instructor or student after class.Be Sober: Sobriety is mandatory. If you exhibit signs of intoxication, we may ask you to leave.Responsible Use of Props: We strongly encourage you to bring your own mat & towel, but some of our studios have mats available to rent. If you rent a mat, YOU MUST BRING A TOWEL. Please do not let mats, props, or straps come into contact with your genitals. Be mindful: don’t sit on communal studio props, and put blankets or bolsters UNDER your mat.If you experience or witness a rule violation, please notify your teacher ASAP to help us identify people involved, and you will remain anonymous. While we prefer to be notified in person, you can also email us at info@nakedinmotion.com. The instructor reserves the right to ask anyone to leave, and Naked in Motion management reserves the right to revoke further class privileges._______________Want to support the Naked! mission?

SF: Food + History + Art Tour,"August 06, 2023, 12:00 PM","August 06, 2023, 03:00 PM","16th and Church Street, San Francisco, CA 94114","What makes the SF: Food + History + Art tour different from other SF food tours?Food: The Mission District is renowned for having some of the best food in San Francisco. From the Chinese in the 1850's, to Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, to successive waves of migration from India, Vietnam and Thailand in the last fifty years, each culture has left its mark on the culinary landscape of SF. And we haven’t even mentioned Latin America or Japan yet! Although the Mission District is known for being at the epicenter of Latino culture in the city, its food scene is in fact very varied - and very good.History: San Francisco has a fascinating story too. We start the tour at the Misión San Francisco de Asís, which is the birthplace of modern SF. We'll give you an overview of the city's history, from the dog days of the Spanish Empire, to being part of Mexico, to the Gold Rush era, through the Great Fire and up to today, as the city transforms once again. You'll have a chance to learn all about it.Art: We have some amazing art in the city (especially if you think of the world class museums in the Bay Area), but the Mission District is arguably the best neighborhood for public murals. We'll visit the Clarion Alley Mural Project, as well as enjoying amazing street art like the Women's Building. It's also a great way to get a better understanding of this often complicated - and sometimes misunderstood - city.Join us on our SF food tour and TRULY experience the best of San Francisco.Our tours can sell out.

Whether you are new to climbing or a seasoned veteran, we would love for you to join us in a discussion of basic emergency preparedness for the outdoors. We will discuss what to bring, what to know, and ways to stay safe. Join us for this lively and informative discussion and thematic giveaways, and then stay for one of NYC's best outdoor boulders - Rat Rock. Volunteers from NY3C will happily help out new climbers at the event. What are Mini-Clinics?: The outdoors should be for everyone, but not everyone has the access to the knowledge and education around it. NY3C is hosting mini-clinics to help bridge the gap to make the outdoors more accessible.Location: This event will take place at Rat Rock. Rat Rock is designated as Umpire Rock on Central Park maps. If you come up 7th Ave from Times Square and enter the park you see a playground straight ahead. Rat Rock is on the left. Rat Rock is in the SW corner of the park near the 59th Street Columbus Circle station. The SW side of the rock is clearly seen as you approach it from the park entrance.If you have any trouble accessing or finding Rat Rock, please call or text 765-994-1138. Cost: Mini-Clinics are FREE to attend, but if you would like to make a financial contribution for this clinic it would be much appreciated.

Rain Date: If for any reason the weather does not agree with our plans, the alternative rain date will be announced via Instagram story and emailed to registrants (follow us @nycclimbingcollective).Accessibility info: Central Park only has bouldering, which is shorter walls without a rope. Please understand all falls are ""ground"" falls, meaning the climber will land on the ground below. Climbing is inherently dangerous; you climb at your own risk. Central Park has accessible restrooms, but they are ample distance away from the boulders.
