In a post-screening conversation moderated by Miranda Massie, director and founder of the Climate Museum, panelists Vince Warren (Director, Center for Constitutional Rights) and Professor Mia White (Department of Environmental Studies, The New School) will join filmmakers Daniel Goldhaber and Dan Garber to discuss the portrayal of radical social movements throughout history and the strategies and stakes of environmental activism today. (Depending on the outcome of the SAG-AFTRA strike, additional panelists are also possible.) How to Blow Up a Pipeline follows a group of eight individuals who come together to sabotage an oil pipeline in West Texas, taking direct action against an industry that has wreaked irreversible damage on their lives and communities. In a time when record-breaking heat waves, forest fires, and myriad climate catastrophes manifest the consequences of combustion of fossil fuels, this film presents at once a searing critique and a propulsive, character-driven story for our time.",The Climate Museum,https://climatemuseum.org/2023-events/howtoblowupapipeline,NYC

Bitcoin Mining in Quebec: Powering Innovation & Economic Growth,"September 21, 2023, 01:00 PM","September 21, 2023, 05:00 PM","1000 Rue de La Gauchetière O #2100, Montréal, QC H3B 4W5, Canada","Overview:  Quebec’s status as an early Canadian leader in Bitcoin mining development has led to diverse benefits like new provincial revenue, technology innovation, and a growing ecosystem of disruptive blockchain and financial services companies. With a rapid expansion predicted for Web3 platforms and energy-intensive technologies like AI, the province’s mining sector could play a strong role in developing the data centre infrastructure that will help Quebec stay competitive in the new digital economy. Mining is about so much more than just Bitcoin – join the Canadian Blockchain Consortium’s Montreal event to discover the opportunities created by the mining industry and what it could mean to Quebec’s digital future.  Panel Topic: Mining Data Centres as an Economic DriverSynopsis: Successful Bitcoin mining hubs have discovered that the benefits of the industry extend beyond the establishment of profitable companies. In regions like Texas, mining firms have rejuvenated post-industrial towns, created high-value jobs and educational programs, and supported the development of important infrastructure and civic services, ranging from roads to community centres. Join this expert panel to learn why miners have a vested interest in long-term relationships, and how the ecosystems of blockchain companies that form around them can help transform municipalities into innovation hubs. Panel Topic: Leveraging Bitcoin Mining ConvergenceSynopsis: The true power of Bitcoin mining is in its convergence with key industries. In Quebec, mining data centres can play an important role in making renewables more profitable, increasing the sustainability of agriculture, and supporting the growth of disruptive digital companies that will benefit the province’s global competitiveness. In other parts of the world, mining has been an accelerant for green infrastructure development and a valuable revenue source for electricity grids due to its flexibility as a power consumer. Join this panel of mining leaders to discover how the industry can benefit Quebec’s near-term energy stability and long-term innovation future.",https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/canada-blockchain-consortium-20013216686,https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/bitcoin-mining-in-quebec-powering-innovation-economic-growth-tickets-607928990977,MTL

Summer Forest Explorations,"September 09, 2023, 09:30 AM","September 09, 2023, 12:00 PM","300 Elm Street, Medford, MA 02155","Join Claire O'Neill & Kathy McGlathery for a lovely Biodiversity walk in the Fells exploring how seasons pass and shape our plants and wildlife in our beautiful urban forest. We'll enjoy, observe and record the flora and fauna in various locations of the woods, starting from the Flynn Rink Parking lot. This is part of Earthwise Aware's biodiversity and phenology studies that collect data about the impact of climate change on the synchronicity of fauna and flora phenophases (i.e., observable stages or phases in the annual life cycle of a plant or animal that can be defined by a start and endpoint). This is a great opportunity to learn how to be alert and in tune with our environment and to discover our urban woodland's biodiversity and cycles. ⚠ IMPORTANT: PLEASE DO NOT BE A NO-SHOW!!! Our free offerings are frequently waitlisted, so if you cannot attend, please tell us a few days before the events so we can give your spot to another person who wants to participate. Thanks for your understanding and courtesy!ⓘ Why limit the number of attendees? EwA caps the attendance size of its events so that they remain low-impact and ethical for the wildlife and habitats that we document. ◇ What to Wear & Bring: Although these will be slow-paced hikes,  please dress appropriately and consider wearing long pants (for the possibility of ticks, poison ivy, etc.) and sturdy hiking shoes.

Sustainability & Biodiversity Conservation with Mazin Qumsiyeh,"August 10, 2023, 05:30 PM","August 10, 2023, 09:00 PM","565 Boylston Street, Boston, MA 02116","Join Mazin Qumsiyeh and Jessie Chang for a reception in the Lothrop Auditorium at 5:30 PM Program begins at 7:00 PM• Mazin Qumsiyeh was born in the Shepherds’ Field near Bethlehem in a Christian Family. He previously served at US universities including Tennessee, Duke and Yale. He is founder and volunteer director of the Palestine Institute for Biodiversity and Sustainability (PIBS) at Bethlehem University (http://palestinenature.org). Qumsiyeh published over 170 scientific papers, over 30 book chapters, hundreds of articles, and several books on topics ranging from cultural heritage to human rights to biodiversity conservation to cancer. He oversaw a number of projects ranging from formulating the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan to empowerment projects with farmers, women, and children that benefitted tens of thousands. He is laureate of the Paul K. Feyerabend Foundation award the Takreem award among others. See also http://qumsiyeh.orgHow do we find hope when events and news are of oppression and repression and the global environmental nakba (catastrophe)? Our earth faces climate change, habitat destruction, pollution, invasive species, overexploitation, rampant inequality, and wars/conflict. How are we to ensure sustainable human and natural communities against all odds? Palestine is the Western part of the Fertile Crescent where humans first developed agriculture. This is why this part of Western Asia was the cradle of civilizations and monotheistic religions. Can this geographic spot generate modules of sustainability in the bleakest of conditions? Can these models be applicable to other countries? These and other questions are addressed.Qumsiyeh is accompanied by his wife Jessie Chang, a co-founder and co-director and volunteer director at the institute. Both donated their money and are full time volunteers at the institute.

"Refillery and Zero waste store located in Worcester, MA","July 22, 2023, 11:00 AM","July 22, 2023, 05:00 PM","78 Burncoat St., Worcester, MA 01605","We are committed to reducing our carbon footprint. Join us on the road to refill!Worcester's FIRST REFILLERY is exactly what you need to GO GREEN!WHAT IS A REFILLERY? A refillery is a retail store designed to help you reduce your single-use plastic consumption by offering the option to reuse and refill your own containers again and again with household and personal care products. Refilleries are often more “zero waste” than your average bulk food stores and many refilleries actually return their empty bulk containers to the product manufacturers to be refilled again and again, i.e., creating a closed-loop packaging system. So, now that you know what a refillery is, why are they important and why is it important to refill your products?Well, refilling reduces waste, specifically plastic waste, and in a time period where we are exponentially producing more and more plastics but are only recycling 9% of the plastic that we throw away, our whole production and consumption system needs to change.But a simple start that you can do is to ditch the “reduce, reuse, recycle” mindset that mainly just focuses on recycling, and to switch to a “reduce, reuse, REFILL” mindset. By choosing to reuse your containers rather than recycling them or tossing them in the garbage we can save resources and energy.At Refill 78, at the Burncoat Center for Arts and Wellness, you will find an ever expanding refill station stocked with body care and household products. Bring your empty containers for refill, or grab one of ours.  Pay by the ounce.Our refillery also offers ample bath, body, and household products made with minimal to no packaging, and single use alternatives for everyday life.Click here for list of items on our website: https://www.bcawworcester.com/refillery-sustainable-livingBulk products available in our RefilleryTo purchase any of our bulk refill items, please visit us in store.

Long Lane Farm partners with ERICD and the Natural Resources Conservation Service to follow smart-environmental practices.T﻿his event is FREE - please RSVP through Eventbrite.F﻿or questions please contact Nate Lukas at nlukas.ericd@gmail.comM﻿ore about the farm:Camille and Devin were first a married couple before they became a farming team. Camille started farming in 2013 at Little River Farm, which she managed until 2022. After years of supporting Camille in her farming dream, Devin decided to quit her office job and become a farmer in 2021 after they acquired their dream property and farm house in Warren in 2020.Long Lane Farm was started in 2023 with the goal to create a farm that can support a family and provide abundant produce to the surrounding community. Instead of driving our produce all over the state, our goal is to have our CSA members and customers come to our farm to pick up their shares, shop at our farm stand and attend our annual spring plant sale.We want our farm to be a welcoming gathering place for our neighbors and customers. Long Lane farm has three high tunnels which we grow in year- round and a nursery where we grow our increasingly popular micro greens. All of our products are grown using organic and no-till practices. These practices and our attention to detail produce a high quality, delicious, and nutritious product. Our vegetables are harvested the day before the customer receives them so that they are extra fresh and have a long shelf life. You will taste the difference.P﻿hotos courtesy Long Lane Farm.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-eastern-rhode-island-conservation-district-ericd-23421370927,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tour-of-long-lane-farm-tickets-660521717237,Boston

How do we navigate this new age of extremes? In A Traveler's Guide to the End of the World, David Gessner takes readers on an eye-opening tour of climate hotspots from the Gulf of Mexico to the burning American West to New York City to the fragile Outer Banks, where homes are being swallowed by the seas. He does so with his usual sense of humor, compassion, and a willingness to talk to anyone, providing an informative and sobering yet convivial guide for the age of fire, heat, wind, and water.Gessner approaches scientists and thinkers with a father's question: What will the world be like in forty-two years? Gessner was forty-two when his daughter, Hadley, was born. What will the world be like in 2064, when Hadley is his age now? What is the future of weather? The future of heat, storms, and fire? What exactly will our children be facing? A Traveler's Guide to the End of the World tells a story of climate crisis that will both entertain and shake people awake to the necessity of navigating this new age together.David Gessner is the author of Quiet Desperation, Savage Delight: Sheltering with Thoreau in the Age of Crisis, Leave It As It Is: A Journey Through Theodore Roosevelt’s American Wilderness, and the New York Times–bestselling All the Wild That Remains: Edward Abbey, Wallace Stegner and the American West. Chair of the Creative Writing Department at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and founder and editor-in-chief of Ecotone, Gessner lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, with his wife, the novelist Nina de Gramont, and their daughter, Hadley.Nina de Gramont’s latest novel, The Christie Affair, is an international and New York Times bestseller, and the Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick for February, 2022. The Christie Affair has been translated into more than twenty languages. Nina is also the author of a collection of short stories, as well as the novels Gossip of the Starlings and The Last September. She has written several YA novels (Every Little Thing in the World, Meet Me at the River, The Boy I Love, and — under the pen name Marina Gessner — The Distance From Me to You). Nina teaches creative writing at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. She lives with her daughter, her dog Isabelle, and her husband, the writer David Gessner.

But following the public assassination of a dozen climate criminals, Emi’s mother, Kristina, disappears as a possible suspect, and Emi’s illusions of utopia are shattered. A determined Emi and her father, Larch, journey from their home in Nuuk, Greenland to New York City, now a lightly populated storm-surge outpost built from the ruins of the former metropolis. But they aren’t the only ones looking for Kristina.Thirty years earlier, Larch first came to New York with a team of volunteers to save the city from rising waters and torrential storms. Kristina was on the frontlines of a different battle, fighting massive wildfires that ravaged the western United States. They became part of a movement that changed the world­—The Great Transition—forging a new society and finding each other in process.Alternating between Emi’s desperate search for her mother and a meticulously rendered, heart-stopping account of her parents’ experiences during The Great Transition, this novel beautifully shows how our actions today determine our fate tomorrow. A triumphant debut, The Great Transition is a breathtaking rendering of our near future, told through the story of one family trying to protect each other and the place we all call home.Nick Fuller Googins has published short stories and essays in The Paris Review, the Los Angeles Times, The Southern Review, and elsewhere. He lives in Maine, and works as an elementary school teacher. The Great Transition is his first novel.Moderator Miriam Wasser is a senior reporter with WBUR's climate and environment team.

About the Alnoba Peace Foundation
A world in need of healing
From climate change to the impact of technology on our minds and the economy, our world is in crisis. A winner-take-all society isolates us from each other and from the earth that sustains us. Our communities are broken, consumption and waste run rampant, and we are severed from the healing power of the natural world.
Both we and the world need a change. Start that change on the inside. You can overcome the harmful and destructive patterns imposed on you by this broken world we’re living in, opening to a more natural and authentic way of engaging with yourself and our planet.
The power to change
There are both ancient and pioneering tools you can use to rewrite your patterns, breaking free of the old way of thinking and being as you tap into something stronger: a way of living that connects us harmoniously to both each other and the earth we share.
Manny Muros has spent decades studying, practicing and sharing the spiritual techniques that lead to greater self-awareness and self-realization. His wisdom teachings are insights gained through a lifetime of deep practice and exploration. Through meditation and affirmative practices, he teaches students how to center, deconstruct old patterns and recover a truer way of being.
The sacred land of Alnoba, with its pristine fields and forests and inspiring collection of outdoor art, serves as a potent space for undertaking this journey of transformation.
Be the difference
To use the ancient words of wisdom: as it is above, so it is below. The world we cultivate inside ourselves makes a real impact on the one that surrounds us. By changing one, we impact the other.
Step forward into your own change, breaking free of a paradigm that destroys both our well-being and that of our planet. Discover a healthier, more authentic alternative that empowers you to be the change you seek.

But when a mechanical mishap sends the two traveling back through time, they'll have to work as a team to return to the present day.In order for the time machine to send them back, the unlikely duo must gather data on recycling throughout the ages - from sustainable marketplaces in Edo Japan to garbage-gobbling pigs in 19th-century NYC. Yet the closer the team gets to the present day, the more that plastic presents a problem: they're running out of time.Harnessing their frustration over the daunting ecological future they've inherited, Charlie and Oliver discover the ways in which they can use their sustainability knowledge to return home and build a better earth.In this sweeping educational adventure that transports readers across continents and centuries, Washington Post contributor Katie Wheeler invites readers into the history of recycling and how students can reduce plastic waste. Wheeler's fresh journal-style graphic novel acknowledges the reality of plastic pollution while offering accessible activist solutions, playfully-illustrated sustainability tips, and an optimistic look into how modern scientists are combating waste. Books for a Better Earth are designed to inspire children to become active, knowledgeable participants in caring for the planet they live on.O﻿rder Team TrashThis event is free to attend, though registration is required through the link provided.

The Balance of Energy between all thingsLocated on a historic farm estate, Orenda winery blends rustic-charm with classic-elegance. Orenda is the perfect location for your event.Orenda Winery brought together three friends with a shared commitment—to build community and to bring Orenda to winemaking. We believe wine should maintain a balance between bold and subtle flavors. To execute this vision, we have partnered with some of the highest elevation vineyards in Washington state in both Yakima Valley and Columbia Valley. High elevation provides a cool climate with late ripening fruit. This allows the grapes more time to mature, making wine less bold and significantly more subtle than wines from warmer regions. When aged in small French oak barrels, the results are complex, dynamic flavors reminiscent of an old-world style rarely found in Washington wines.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/della-terra-14728494784,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/farm-to-table-winemakers-dinner-featuring-della-terra-orenda-winery-tickets-633333907767,Seattle

In our culture, however, we have forgotten how to share our grief with one another.  In addition to our personal losses, given the emergent climate crisis and its impacts – the extinction of species, the COVID pandemic, and the unrest and turmoil within human societies – the burden of grief that we are carrying as individuals can begin to feel unbearable. There are very few spaces where we are invited to experience and express this complex grief in community. This retreat will utilize Francis Weller’s “Five Gates of Grief” to connect participants to their distinct and multifaceted experiences of grief in the context of a ""sudden village."". The weekend will be facilitated by experienced grief mentors who have apprenticed in the grief ritual tradition of the Dagara tribe as brought to the U.S. and shared by Malidoma and Sobonfu Somé. We have been oriented to this tradition through mentorship with Francis Weller and others. Participants will be guided through chanting, poetry, teaching, writing exercises, small group sharing, and the creation of a grief shrine. Our time together will culminate in a communal grief ritual. All participation is invitational; nothing is ""required"" beyond being present with and sharing the griefs you are carrying, to the best of your ability.Fee: $400 - Early Bird Registration by August  15; $450 after August 15. If the fee presents a barrier to your participation, please let us know.R﻿ecent significant loss: If you have experienced a significant or traumatic loss within the last three months, please reach out to speak with a facilitator before registering.Registration Deadline: Thursday, September 28.

A Closing Reception for the Terminus Glacier Memorial Project and Art Show,"August 25, 2023, 06:00 PM","August 25, 2023, 08:00 PM","1502 East Lauridsen Boulevard, Port Angeles, WA 98362","Terminus: Paying Tribute to Olympic’s Melting Glaciers through Art and EducationBetween 1982 and 2009, the number of glaciers in the Olympic Mountains shrank by nearly a third. There are approximately 164 glaciers left, and many will cease to exist in our lifetime. While we may not be able to spare glacial ice from the ravages of climate change, we can preserve what the Olympic glaciers mean to us. The Terminus Glacier Memorial project, supported by donors of Washington’s National Park Fund, launched in 2022 with the creation of an Artist in Residence program at Olympic National Park.T﻿he project coordinated a group of 40 talented volunteer artists and assigned each person to memorialize one of the park's glaciers through a diverse array of media including poetry, painting, fiber arts, film, embroidery, animation, stained glass, and more. The goal is to provide a visual timeline of each glacier's life and story and draw attention to the impacts of climate change on the park's ecosystems.To learn more, visit: Terminus Glacier Memorial project, where you can see the Terminus Art that has already been created with new works of art added weekly. When all art is complete, it will be a part of a live summer gallery show. V﻿isitors can view this exhibition in person at the Port Angeles Fine Arts Center from July 7th - September 3rd during regular hours: Thursday - Sunday, 11 AM - 5 PM.A Closing Reception for the Terminus Glacier Memorial Project and Art Show will be held on Friday, August 25th from 6:00 - 8:00 pm at the Port Angeles Peninsula College (Pirate Union Building).

"Chuckanut Radio Hour Featuring David B. Williams, Homewaters","September 14, 2023, 07:00 PM","September 14, 2023, 08:00 PM","1314 Harris Avenue, Bellingham, WA 98225","Take a deep dive with us into the vibrant history of the Puget Sound with David B. Williams, a naturalist, author, and educator, to discuss his book Homewaters. His many books include the award-winning Too High and Too Steep: Reshaping Seattle's Topography and Seattle Walks: Discovering History and Nature in the City.  David B. Williams will be interviewed by bestselling author Erica Bauermeister, directly after they return to land from the Schooner Zodiac Books a'Sail Cruise, 2023! Click here for more information on a book group at sea!Doors open and music begins at 6:30pm!Musical Guest: Ben BauermeisterSpaces are limited and REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED to secure your spot so don't delay. About the bookNot far from Seattle skyscrapers live 150-year-old clams, more than 250 species of fish, and underwater kelp forests as complex as any terrestrial ecosystem. For millennia, vibrant Coast Salish communities have lived beside these waters dense with nutrient-rich foods, with cultures intertwined through exchanges across the waterways. Transformed by settlement and resource extraction, Puget Sound and its future health now depend on a better understanding of the region's ecological complexities.Focusing on the area south of Port Townsend and between the Cascade and Olympic mountains, Williams uncovers human and natural histories in, on, and around the Sound. In conversations with archaeologists, biologists, and tribal authorities, Williams traces how generations of humans have interacted with such species as geoducks, salmon, orcas, rockfish, and herring. He sheds light on how warfare shaped development and how people have moved across this maritime highway, in canoes, the mosquito fleet, and today's ferry system. The book also takes an unflinching look at how the Sound's ecosystems have suffered from human behavior, including pollution, habitat destruction, and the effects of climate change.Witty, graceful, and deeply informed, Homewaters weaves history and science into a fascinating and hopeful narrative, one that will introduce newcomers to the astonishing life that inhabits the Sound and offers longtime residents new insight into and appreciation of the waters they call home.""Homewaters is a sweeping exploration of how a place shapes lives. It begins with glaciers and volcanoes carving up Puget Sound, and examines early Native communities’ relationships with their environment, colonial exploitation of natural resources and efforts to better understand how keystone and emblematic species like salmon, orca, rockfish, herring, kelp and more are enduring the conditions of the Sound today."" -- CrosscutAbout the presentersDavid B. Williams is a writer, historian, and tour guide focused on the intersection between people and landscape, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.Erica Bauermeister is the author of the bestselling novel The School of Essential Ingredients, Joy for Beginners, and The Lost Art of Mixing.

We'll cover the basics on bees, the progress of bees through the seasons, how to keep bees healthy, and what to look for at this time of year. We’ll also talk about swarming, pest management, and more. The class will also address special concerns of urban beekeeping.  Are there city or county restrictions on beekeeping where you live? How can you be the best bee steward possible in an area where bees and people will inevitably meet? The class is designed for beginners so no prerequisite knowledge is required. You will get to see live bees and will most likely be able to get into a bee suit and see the bees in a hive. For your safety, please wear long sleeves, long pants, and closed-toe shoes.Instructors: Alex is a third-year beekeeper and San Francisco Beekeepers Association board member. As a gay person, he encourages people of all backgrounds to get involved in beekeeping. His favorite part of beekeeping is watching the industrious worker bees coming and going on a warm day, imagining where in San Francisco they’ve been to gather nectar, pollen, propolis, and water for the colony.Lindsay Wilson has a lifelong love of gardening, plants, and animals learned from her grandparents. As veterinary science teacher, she enjoys sharing a sense of awe and appreciation for our natural world through the art of beekeeping.

In the building industry, we often think new is better, wanting our projects to begin as a clean slate or “white box”. Learn about how designing and planning for the reuse of buildings and materials can help reduce our environmental impact. Listen to experts from Gensler, Rheaply, and Kay Chesterfield on how they are putting this concept into practice.Before the panel, we will enjoy refreshments and a terrarium building activity to get to know each other better and practice some creative reuse. In the spirit of circularity, we encourage you to bring a jar, rocks, or fun found-objects, and plant cuttings to share with the group.This year’s WIG theme is “Self-Titled”. We are constantly reinventing ourselves, our careers, and our points of view. As we come out of the pandemic and return to in-person events, what do we want our WIG community to look like?

This area was referred to as ""over the tracks"" by the residents of Parchester Village, one of the few communities where minorities were allowed to purchase homes after World War II. The new residents were promised the marsh would always be open for recreation, nature appreciation, and views of the water. Beginning in the 1970's, it appeared that promise would be broken, as developers schemed to drain the marsh and develop the wetlands. Parchester resident Reverend Richard Dotson and his son, Whitney, led the community in a campaign to preserve the wetlands, stating ""everyone neglects the needs of low income communities to access to quality of life.""Ultimately,  the wetland area was acquired by the East Bay Regional Park District and the marsh renamed  in honor of the Dotson family. The Park District  has worked to restore the wetlands ecosystem and  protect Parchester Village from rising sea level and other dangers of climate change.O﻿ur adventure also includes hiking the beautiful Bay View and Woods trails, where we'll explore the serene natural  and explosive cultural history of the park area, host to numerous dynamite factories beginning in the 1880's through mid 20th century.N﻿orth Richmond is a Greenbelt Alliance Resilience Hotspot.

Sustainable Gardening Series: Fall 2023,"October 21, 2023, 10:00 AM","November 04, 2023, 12:00 PM","1590 7th Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94122"," Introduction to Sustainable Gardening Series - Fall 2023October 21st, 28th, and November 4th - Saturdays from 10am to 12pm. Cost: $30 for the full three-part series, and receive a $10 gift card at each workshop. Sponsored by the San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionThe Introduction to Sustainable Gardening series is a three-part workshop series designed to help you transform your yard into a thriving, sustainable garden. This course will teach you everything you need to know to nurture perennial gardens that conserve water, provide beauty, and attract pollinators and beneficial insects.San Francisco is a beautiful and unique city, with year-round mild temperatures and dry, foggy summers. Learn what plants are adapted to our coastal climate and grow without the need for toxic pesticides or large amounts of water. This course will focus on native and drought-tolerant ornamental gardens but will cover broad topics that can also apply to vegetable gardening.The full series is $30, but you will get $10 gift cards to the Urban Farmer Store at each workshop (for a total of $30 in gift cards if you attend the two workshops).Registering will sign you up for the full series of three workshops. Please only register if you plan to attend all three sessions. SERIES SUMMARY: Part I: Sustainable Garden Design  This workshop will teach you how to design a beautiful, functional, and thriving home garden space. San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco’s dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill. Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides. Ellyn will discuss the notion that most plant health problems are caused by poor growing conditions or improper planting, and that pests and diseases may be secondary problems. Plant health care involves a combination of strategies including monitoring, and you'll learn strategies to attract beneficial insects, and keep pests, diseases, and weeds at bay naturally. Instructor Ellyn Shea is a Bay Area gardener, garden coach, Certified Arborist, consultant, and educator. She is a longtime Garden for the Environment teacher and supporter and shares her extensive gardening knowledge in this workshop series.

Generating over half of the state’s greenhouse gases, the transportation sector is a major part of state and local decarbonization goals. At the same time, the state’s transportation infrastructure is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially increased storm activity and sea level rise. This session shares how the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and BART have recently explored bold changes to their transportation infrastructure and regulation to confront both challenges. SFMTA’s Climate Roadmap tackles the city’s ambitious emission and mode share goals through a suite of transformative interventions that draw on international case studies. In addition, their Waterfront Resiliency Transportation Assessment addresses the substantial impact that sea level rise and potential defense strategies will have on the city’s eastern waterfront and ways to adapt the transportation network to such a reality. BART's Sustainability Action Plan outlines BART's strategy to reduce emissions, optimize energy use, and incorporate climate resilience into districtwide operations. BART also has a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to reduce or eliminate risks to the system from natural disasters, particularly those that would be exacerbated by climate change.The panel will include representatives from the projects discussing the innovative analytical approaches and implementation frameworks leveraged, with lessons that other jurisdictions can utilize for their own climate mitigation and adaptation. The session will include a moderated discussion and Q&A to engage with the audience.Program ParticipantsModerators: 	Taylor McAdam, Senior Transportation Planner, Fehr & Peers Panelists: 	 Tim Doherty, Policy and Long-Range Planning Team Lead - San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency  (SFMTA)Matt  Goyne, Principal - Fehr & Peers Michael Cox,  Principal Sustainability Analyst - San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)When:	Wednesday August 9th, 5:30 -7:30pmWhere:	Port of San Francisco, Pier 1 The Embarcadero, Bayside Room, San Francisco, CA, 94105Cost:		$60 WTS Members / $80 Non-Members / $10 Students or UnemployedFood:		Buffet style dinner & drinks will be providedRSVP:	Please RSVP by August 4 via Eventbrite Here﻿For questions, please email us at ProgramsWTSSanFrancisco@gmail.comEmpowering Women, Transforming Transportation.

Mid-Century Modernism in Berkeley? Featuring Journalist Dave Weinstein,"August 02, 2023, 07:00 PM","August 02, 2023, 08:30 PM","2315 Durant Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704","What is the signature architecture of the Berkeley Hills? Chances are good that brown-shingled Arts and Crafts homes quickly come to mind. But modern houses built from the 1940s through the 1970s — and, indeed, still today — make a sizable contribution to some of the most beautiful and, arguably, most mysterious neighborhoods anywhere.
On Wednesday, August 2, at 7 p.m., architecture enthusiast and journalist Dave Weinstein will take us on a photo tour of some of these distinctive homes in Berkeley and beyond, discuss why modernism came late to the Bay Area, and explain why — and with whom — it proved so popular. We’ll also learn how this style, which looks so different from Arts and Crafts buildings, actually is deeply indebted to the Craftsman ethos.
Tickets for this program are $5 for club members and $10 for non-members. Please register early so we can be sure to accommodate everyone comfortably and safely. Masks are strongly encouraged.
For years, Dave has written about Bay Area architecture for the San Francisco Chronicle. His popular books include Signature Architects of the Bay Area, Berkeley Rocks, and It Came from Berkeley: How Berkeley Changed the World. For the past twenty years, his well-researched articles have appeared in CA-Modern magazine, which focuses on the mid-century modern tract homes that the famed developer Joseph Eichler built in the Bay Area, as well as on other topics related to modern design.
Dave also has worked to publicize and preserve the historic and natural landscapes of El Cerrito, where he lives. He is president of the El Cerrito Historical Society and El Cerrito Trail Trekkers. He was instrumental in saving and restoring the Cerrito Theater (now the Rialto Cinemas Cerrito) and in protecting the Madera Open Space by having it added to the city’s Hillside Natural Area.
Dave grew up on Long Island and studied art history at Columbia University and journalism at UC-Berkeley.

Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyABOUT THE ORGANIZERSTogether, Krystle Moody Wood and Carolynn Box have established themselves as some of the world's leading experts in microfiber pollution- an issue easily recognized at the intersection of oceans and textiles. With Krystle's background in materials innovation and sustainable textile systems, and Carolynn's background in ocean conservation and plastic pollution, this program merges both of their worlds and expertise.  From hosting an 85 person workshop with NOAA's Marine Debris Program in 2020 and co-authoring the ""California Microfiber Update: Textile Perspective"" to recently co-authoring a congressional report, The Report on Microfiber Pollution, with the EPA Trash Free Waters Program and NOAA's Marine Debris Program on behalf of the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC), Krystle and Carolynn have been able to bring together key learnings from science, industry, government and academia to improve communication cross-discipline and advance toward solutions. In May 2021, Carolynn and Krystle hosted an experiential sail program with local non-profit Fibershed on ""Building Regional Textile Systems For Healthy Soils and Healthy Seas"" on the Call of the Sea's Matthew Turner.  The success of this program was featured in the special Marine Pollution issue of ECO Magazine in October of 2021.From 2021-2022, Carolynn and Krystle served as advisors for the Conservation X Labs Microfiber Innovation Challenge supporting transformative innovations targeting microfiber pollution upstream within the textile industry. I﻿n October 2022, Carolynn and Krystle hosted the inaugural Textile X Ocean Connector sail that brought together 65 participants from more than 35 organizations to participate in a thoughtfully curated program that educated participants and  encouraged collaboration to work towards solutions.  We are honored that our attendees wanted to see us make the Textile X Ocean Connector Sail an annual event!Both Krystle and Carolynn have served on the San Francisco Bay Microplastics Working Group for many years and are active in the ocean conservation space- continuing to find links where they can use their superpowers in connecting passionate people, providing educational opportunities, and fostering creative collaborations to support the development of a blue material world. Image credit: Paige Green PhotographyCarlie Herring, a research scientist at NOAA Marine Debris Program and co-author of the SOS 2.0 Report on Microfiber Pollution, is providing guests with an overview of the upcoming congressional report to spark discussion with attendees about federal action and policy.

This is the seventh Silicon Valley Foresight Four Seminar Series featuring solutions to advance the goal of a sustainable future with Net Zero emissions by 2050. Innovation in Materials for the Circular EconomyThe goal of the Circular Economy is to solve problems including climate change, pollution and environmental degradation. This can be accomplished by stepping back from the conventional approach for how we make things today to inventing new materials, methods and designs that plan ahead for using non-toxic ingredients to make the products we use every day and to design them so that they can be recovered and reused or deconstructed and reconstructed into new products enabling the materials to be used over and over again, without creating waste.  We will discuss: ➢	What is the circular economy and what are its benefits?➢	Who is innovating in this area and their examples?➢	What are the opportunities for the future of material science?➢	How can we accelerate the transition to circular materials?Additional Information on the Circular Economy:According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation one of the leaders in this field: “In our current economy, we take materials from the Earth, make products from them, and eventually throw them away as waste – the process is linear. In a circular economy, by contrast, we stop waste being produced in the first place. The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design:●	Eliminate waste and pollution●	Circulate products and materials (at their highest value)●	Regenerate natureIt is underpinned by a transition to renewable energy and materials. A circular economy decouples economic activity from the consumption of finite resources. It is a resilient system that is good for business, people and the environment.”Date:		Monday, August 7, 2023Time:	   5:30 PM - 7:30 PM (Registration and networking begin at 5:00PM)Location: Plug and Play Tech Center, 440 N Wolfe Rd, Sunnyvale, CA 94085Cost:		Free but registration is requiredYou will have an opportunity to network in person to share your thoughts and experiences with peers and to speak in-depth with each of the panelists after the formal presentation, while enjoying refreshments.Agenda:5:00 - 5:30 PM  -Registration, Networking5:30 - 7:00 PM  -Panel Presentations, Q&A7:00 - 7:30 PM -NetworkingSpeakers/Panelists:	Dr. William Tarpeh, Assistant Professor, Chemical Engineering, and Civil and Environmental Engineering, Center Fellow at the Precourt Institute For Energy, and the Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford UniversityJesse Simons, Co-Founder and CCO, SolarcycleGeoff Chapin, CEO, CarbonwaveMichael Matthews, Commercial Plant Project Manager, Mango Materials

Carbonwave’s products help reduce and offset emissions from fossil fuels and traditional plastics, while minimizing waste. Their seaweed derived fertilizers and plant performance boosters help soils and crops overcome challenges from environmental stresses like heatwaves, droughts, and soil exhaustion. They are creating a plant-based fabric that relies on the extraction of structural polymers to form films stronger than the seaweed itself and competitive with the strength of other vegan textiles, without relying on polyurethane (PU) plastic for structure and strength. Their SeaBalance line of broad-spectrum emulsifiers have a wide range of applications across cosmetics and skin-care products. Unlike emulsifiers used in cosmetics and personal health that are often made with harmful fossil fuel derivatives, SeaBalance utilizes an all-natural process to make an emulsifier that’s healthy to use, and healthy for the planet. C-Combinator emulsifiers are versatile by nature: they work with formulations ranging from pH 3.5 to pH 9, and are capable of emulsifying a wide variety of oils between 10% to 40% oil content.Michael Matthews is the Commercial Plant Project Manager for Mango Materials.

He earned a bachelor’s in engineering from Dalhousie University and is certified as a California Mechanical Engineer and Professional Engineer (PE). He follows a collaborative and dynamic approach to leadership.About Mango Materials: Mango Materials is a renewable bioproducts company dedicated to developing environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional plastics and polyesters by fermenting and transforming waste methane to produce biopolymers which are then used to create biodegradable products. Mango Materials transforms waste gas streams into affordable, biodegradable materials while creating a positive environmental impact. It produces  naturally occurring biopolymers from waste biogas (methane) that are economically competitive with conventional oil-based materials.They are currently focused on producing Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) which are a potential replacement for some petrochemical-based plastics. They are producing PHA from waste methane gas at a San Francisco Bay Area wastewater treatment plant. PHA is  a family of biopolyesters that can be produced naturally by bacteria and other life forms. PHB is one of the many types of PHA. Unlike PLA and other biopolymers, PHA can biodegrade in many environments, including the oceans. YOPP pellets can be used in injection molding, fiber extrusion, additive manufacturing, and other plastic substitute applications. YOPP and YOPP+ pellets are optimally-formulated for fibers (for apparel and textiles) and rigid goods (for jars, caps, and molded applications). (YOPP is a trade name that stands for “You Oust Polluting Plastics”.)

SF: Food + History + Art Tour,"July 23, 2023, 12:00 PM","July 23, 2023, 03:00 PM","16th and Church Street, San Francisco, CA 94114","What makes the SF: Food + History + Art tour different from other SF food tours?Food: The Mission District is renowned for having some of the best food in San Francisco. From the Chinese in the 1850's, to Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, to successive waves of migration from India, Vietnam and Thailand in the last fifty years, each culture has left its mark on the culinary landscape of SF. And we haven’t even mentioned Latin America or Japan yet! Although the Mission District is known for being at the epicenter of Latino culture in the city, its food scene is in fact very varied - and very good.History: San Francisco has a fascinating story too. We start the tour at the Misión San Francisco de Asís, which is the birthplace of modern SF. We'll give you an overview of the city's history, from the dog days of the Spanish Empire, to being part of Mexico, to the Gold Rush era, through the Great Fire and up to today, as the city transforms once again. You'll have a chance to learn all about it.Art: We have some amazing art in the city (especially if you think of the world class museums in the Bay Area), but the Mission District is arguably the best neighborhood for public murals. We'll visit the Clarion Alley Mural Project, as well as enjoying amazing street art like the Women's Building. It's also a great way to get a better understanding of this often complicated - and sometimes misunderstood - city.Join us on our SF food tour and TRULY experience the best of San Francisco.Our tours can sell out.

Weed’em Out: Native Restoration @ Cascade Creek with Pie Ranch and AMLT,"August 12, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 12, 2023, 02:30 PM","3100 Cabrillo Highway, Pescadero, CA 94060","Join Pie Ranch and the Amah Mutsun Land Trust to remove invasive species from Cascade Creek!9:30am - 2:30pm Volunteer work Session12pm - 1pm Lunch providedVolunteers are needed to help to remove invasive plants in a critical section of the creek. We especially need help removing eucalyptus sprouts from around the creek. Lunch will be served to volunteers between sessions. Spend time outdoors, meet new people, learn about invasive plants and creek habitat, and help restore the ancestral land of the Quiroste Tribe (represented by the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band and Land Trust).Due to the rough terrain, this event is best suited for participants age 16 years and older.When you arrive at Cascade Ranch, meet Pie Ranch and AMLT staff in the parking area next to the first white barn or, if late, follow on foot the event signs from the parking lot to the area of the creek we will be working on. Previous experience is not necessary. We will teach you how to identify the target species and how to remove and process them.Be aware that the areas in which we will be working may contain poison oak, blackberries and other prickly plants like thistle and stinging nettle. Please do your best to arrive on time so that we can all move to the creek area together!What to bring:Work glovesWater bottleHatSunscreenBackpackSturdy work boots or shoesSnacks or personal lunch if preferredLots of energy and a desire to weed out invasive species!Riparian (creekside) restoration is nowadays more important than ever. Indeed, healthy riparian ecosystems promote ecological and climate resilience both within and beyond riparian zones, lead to the accrual and sequestration of carbon and nitrogen in soil, absorb heat and buffer organisms against extreme temperatures. Cascade Ranch is within an area of high biological richness and surrounded by California protected areas. About 1.2 miles of Cascade Creek fall within the boundaries of the property, which is currently managed by the non-profit Pie Ranch. Cascade Creek represents an important habitat connectivity area for a wide array of plants and animals and a potential traditional food source for people. Unfortunately, the riparian zone has been highly affected by the spreading of invasive plant species, which are causing loss of biodiversity and related ecosystem services and products. The 2020 CZU complex fire has further contributed to the increase in number, variety and spread of invasive species along Cascade Creek.Your hard work and participation will help shape the future of this land!

All that is needed for a feast—olives and olive oil, vegetables, nuts, wines, lamb, and more—is cultivated from the soil of our region.In the spirit of a Grand Aïoli, please bring your own table settings, plates (salad, entrée , and dessert plate), silverware, water glasses, and napkins so you can enjoy this communal meal. The menuAperitifs include olives, nuts, and local  rosé wines. The meal is served family-style, with accompanying local wines placed on the tables, starting with passed platters of heirloom tomatoes drizzled with local olive oil and freshly made baguettes. Steamed and grilled local vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, and bowls of garlic-scented aïoli  follow the tomatoes. Next comes the grilled lamb and summer white bean salad. The bottles empty, the bread is eaten, and dessert is served—fruit tart, or as the French say, a galette.

They serve as nurseries for young marine life, giving them a safe place to grow. They protect coastal communities from big storms and help stop the land from being washed away. They are also superheroes fighting climate change by storing a lot of carbon. However, coastal development, unsustainable aquaculture and sea-level rise pose unprecedented threats to these fragile ecosystems now.Join us in this sharing about the wonders of mangroves to people in Singapore and what they are doing to protect them. This sharing will feature voices from students Enya Wong from Nanyang Girls High School and Chloe DeCourcy Hallinan from Raffles Girls Primary School, as well as Dr. Siti M.

Designing for Nature: Ecologically Engineering Artificial Coastal Defences,"August 27, 2023, 02:30 PM","August 27, 2023, 03:30 PM","6 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore, 018974, Singapore","This event is part of the Waves of Change Festival 2023 held at ArtScience Museum on the 5th to 27th of August 2023.Designing for Nature: Ecologically Engineering Artificial Coastal DefencesCoastal urbanisation and climate change are driving the global proliferation of artificial coastal defences. These structures have significant effects on the ecology of marine habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. For example, seawalls are generally homogenous and steep. Due to these differences, artificial defences are poor surrogates for the habitats they replace. Ecological engineering—the integration of ecological principles and engineering for the benefit of both humans and nature—is a form of Nature Based Solution that is being increasingly adopted to alleviate the negative impacts associated with coastal defences by improving their ecological functioning. One of the more successful eco-engineering strategies is to add tiles with complex topographies, microhabitats, and water-retaining features. These can increase the richness and abundance of species reminiscent of native communities. Moving forward, how can we incorporate habitat complexity and green elements into new coastal defence designs, and what additional benefits may they be able to provide?About the host: Dr Peter Todd is an experimental marine ecologist who focusses urban marine systems. He works on increasing understanding of the ecology and functioning of tropical coastal marine organisms and communities under environmental stress. His research is multidisciplinary, synthesising elements of biology, geography and engineering to answer ecological questions. His team has 18 years of experience in the conceptualisation, build, implementation, and analysis of novel experiments, and over a decade designing and testing a wide range of seawall enhancements. Dr Todd is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, where he runs the Experimental Marine Ecology Laboratory and is director of the Bachelor of Environmental Studies programme. He has published over 150 peer-reviewed papers on coastal systems and his lab’s research is featured regularly in both local and international media.

Forest – Beach school @ East,"July 22, 2023, 09:00 AM","July 22, 2023, 12:00 PM","10 Winstedt Road Block A, 02-02, Singapore, 227977, Singapore","A Forest and Beach School in Singapore!
Immerse in a world filled with fisherman boats, fishing villages, colonial houses, lookout towers and a kampong with wildlife!

What is unique about our Forest-Beach School?
Your child gets the best of both worlds to access the forest, sea and beach at Changi and Ubin. Yes, we take boat rides into Pulau Ubin to explore. Most forest schools in Singapore are based at locations where they are more accessible to the trees and greens only.
You receive weekly updates of your child’s experience at the Forest-Beach School from our forest school teachers who are experienced principals, preschool and secondary school teachers.
Your child can choose what they want to do with the wide variety of materials provided each week. Once they settle down on which direction and where they want to go, we set up a base area. Your child can make their own decision on what to play. We provide yarns, kitchen utensils, watercolours, art materials, drinks and many others. Being child-led with choices empowers your child to be more motivated and focused on their chosen task.
Forest School Philosophy 
The Forest-Beach School approach invites children to develop their inner selves and connect with the outer world. This approach is based on the belief that children learn best when they are allowed to explore and interact with nature, engage in unstructured play and take calculated risks.

During the sessions at Pulau Ubin or Changi Beach, the children of various ages will naturally collaborate, allowing them to learn from one another and build relationships. This approach also encourages children to engage in risky play, which helps them to develop their self-awareness and understand their own capabilities, responsibilities, strength and boundaries. Risky play also fosters children’s problem-solving skills, as they learn to assess and manage risks.

The nature of the sessions invites children to co-exist with nature. The time spent outdoors helps children develop a sense of appreciation for the natural world and understand the importance of taking care of the environment.

When the children are emotionally connected with mother nature, when they can feel and see the animals, the seawater, the trees and the earth, they are more likely to understand their role in protecting and loving mother nature more.

In Forest-Beach School, children are presented with freedom of movement. The time and space that is offered to children allow children to go inward and focus on their body’s competency.

Safety forest codes and rules are explained to allow for safe play. We encourage children to trust their bodies, especially during risky play. As leaders hold space for such play, the children develop the necessary thinking process to keep themselves, and their friends safe.

Children will also have plenty of opportunities to develop both language and communication skills as they interact with peers of various age groups.

We engaged Forest School practitioners who are committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for children to explore and build meaning of the world.

This is a collaboration with Hundred Paths, led by Aminah and Sabrina. The sessions are run by qualified leaders.

The sessions are child-led, where children plan and discuss what they would like to do the following week. The final venue on Pulau Ubin, Changi or Pasir Ris Beach depends on the children’s interests and decisions. We respect and honour their request.

What will my child learn at Forest School? 
The Forest School approach is a child-led approach that believes in the holistic development of children. This approach respects that the child is rich in potential, strong, powerful, competent and confident in building relationships. The sessions provide space for children to remember those qualities in nature. Children will also have plenty of opportunities to develop both language and communication skills as they interact with peers of various age groups. In Forest School, children are presented with freedom of movement. The time and space that is offered to children allow children to go inward and focus on their body’s competency.

What ‘progress’/benefits can I see in my child?
Dr Peter Gray mentioned that “Play serves the serious purpose of education. The player is playing for fun; education is a by-product.” A child who plays feels free to take risks and is not afraid of failure because they are not seeking approval from adults. They do know if they fail, there will be no serious real-world consequences. We will also be able to see children gaining confidence in themselves and becoming more resourceful.

They find their own ‘voices’ and are not afraid to speak up. Children who are accustomed to risky play in nature will also naturally develop their sense of balance. They will also be more coordinated in their gross motor. This physical development can support children’s ability to be more attentive and engaged in classrooms.

How do the children stay safe in forest school?
The sessions are run by qualified leaders. Safety forest codes and rules are explained to allow for safe play. We encourage children to trust their bodies, especially during risky play. As leaders hold space for such play, the children develop the necessary thinking process to keep themselves, and their friends safe.

Why commit for the long term?
Children present themselves differently just by being in a natural environment. As they adjust their presence in a natural environment, their behaviours adjust. A usual love for nature and the natural environment usually presents itself as the children are constantly being exposed to it. In our long term sessions, one of the primary aims of our initial sessions is to meet the physiological and basic needs of the children first. FS leaders work to ensure that the children become comfortable within that setting.

Site rules are established and children learn their way around the forest. Leaders ensure that safety needs are met and the children understand the risks and rules. For example, the children learn to navigate risk assessments, explore physical boundaries, use the same site (familiarity), tool talks, understand ‘whatever the weather’ circumstances and have routines.  We observe when they need to run around or when their play is coming to a natural end. This physiological and safety needs usually takes about 5 weeks.

Once these needs have been met, children then develop a sense of belonging and begin to meet their ‘esteem needs’. This too, is dependent on the needs of individual children. Some require a longer time in order to meet their belonging and esteem needs. At this point, the children will start to recognise the Leaders as facilitators. While having the same children every week creates a sense of belonging and love, they start trusting each other, have fun, there’s laughter, reflection activities, they share successes
and acceptance. Their sense of belonging occurs after the children’s physiological and safety needs are met.

As the sense of belonging needs are met, the children then discover their esteem needs. Through social, and physical play in a safe and natural setting, they develop aspects of being human. Having a grounded foundation of esteem needs is something  ‘unteachable.’ A long-term environment like Forest School allows a child to explore having success for himself, not others, learning to self-praise rather than having it externally, has opportunities to repeat things, there is no formal assessment, is child-directed, the child is in control of his learning, he gets to experiment and develop physically. The children’s esteem needs will actualise when their sense of belonging is actualised.

Long term Forest School has many benefits where a child’s SPICES (Social, Physical, Intellectual, Communication, Emotional, Spiritual) have room to develop. These can only ever be developed in long-term projects where self-actualization is then achieved.

Wide Age Range
It is our intention to have a wide age gap of children 3.5 – 12 years old for the Forest-Beach each school. Children who have the opportunity to work together with children of different age groups and abilities, have cultivate more empathy, kindness, awareness, and understanding of social cues and boundaries. This supports children to be more socio-emotional developed and connected with each other.

Singapore ranks the third highest in bullying globally. It is proven that when children are connected and play together, bullying reduces because children have more empathy and can understand from different perspectives better.

Mindful Space have witness so many beautiful learning moments when children of different age groups come together. The older children learn to role model and polish their leadership skills to problem solve; how to include and motivate people with different pace, perspective and abilities, and empower them to think out of the box. The younger children learn better through observation, and feel the sense of belonging and motivation through the team spirit.

What if my child needs more time for drop off or has separation anxiety?
It is normal for a child to feel anxious during drop-off. We encourage the child to sit with those feelings.  Every feeling is valid. Acknowledge your child’s feelings. We encourage you to assure your child confidently that you will see him/her again at drop-off.

We highly recommend that parents drop off when their children are ready so the experience is pleasant (and not stressful!) for the child.

The dynamics of the session change and are different when the parents are around.

The good thing is that children tend to explore out of their comfort zone and be more willing and open when their parents are not around (speaking from experience as a group of educators and mothers!). We believe children learn best when they are given a safe space to explore independently.

Children are dropped off at the Changi Point Ferry Terminal. It is a child-led session; hence the children will discuss as a team where and what they would like to do. They have the option to be at Changi Beach or head to Pulau Ubin.

You can sign up for trial sessions to assess whether your child is ready. We understand that some children need more time to be comfortable in a new environment.

For the trial sessions, if your child needs more time to transit to drop-off slowly, parents can observe from a distance, making themselves as invisible as possible, allowing the child to freely interacts with the environment, teachers, or classmates (no interference at all), while the child knows you are around. From the trial sessions (maximum three), we can assess whether the child is ready for drop-off. Most of the time, children surprise parents with their level of adaptability and resilience. When we trust and have confidence in them, they can feel it and trust themselves better too.

The coaches are trained to hold space for children and we would like them to flourish in our sessions. Let us know how we can honour your child’s needs. We will provide parents with photos and a write-up of the session.

Can I accompany my child to a drop-off session?
We would advise you not to. The dynamics of the group including providing and holding a safe space for children is essential in our sessions. The coaches are trained to hold space for children and we would like them to flourish in our sessions. Special arrangements can be made on a case-to-case basis. Do let us know how we can honour your child’s needs. We will provide parents with photos and a session write-up in the next few days.

What happens when it rains?
For forest-beach school, we will go ahead even if it’s raining and seek shelter at respective area if there are lightning. We teach kids how to be resilient and adaptable with the weather, and how to make the best out of things that are beyond our control. We believe that the different elements in nature offers children a range of learning opportunities.

It is very important that children are dressed appropriately for the weather for them to enjoy it. In Forest School we believe that, “There’s no such thing as bad weather, only inappropriate clothing”. We encourage children to come appropriately attired (a list of recommendations will be given). A raincoat is always handy to have in the child’s bag.

We will conduct drop-off sessions in a safe, sheltered area nearby the designated site.

Will my child be able to refill their water bottle?
Please arrive at the sessions with the appropriate amount of water your child would need for a 2.5-hour session outdoors. We would recommend a litre water bottle to be with them. Coaches will offer children to refill their water bottles if need be. We ensure that children are well-hydrated during our sessions.

Are there toilet facilities?
There are toilets located at the Mindful Space Changi Studio and Pulau Ubin.

Are there first-aid-trained facilitators?
We will assign at least one first-aid trained coach to the session at all times.

Sustainable Digital Transformation: Making Sustainability an Advantage,"July 26, 2023, 08:00 AM","July 26, 2023, 11:10 AM","1 Fullerton Square, Singapore, 049178, Singapore","Achieving SG Green Goals Through Leveraging Innovative Technologies and Collaborative Efforts of Stakeholders  The inevitability of digital transformation in government is undeniable, and its progress will persist. However, it is not enough to simply adopt digital technologies; instead, they must be leveraged to their fullest potential to guarantee enduring value and advantages for both organisations and the public at large. To establish a sustainable change process, it is crucial to carefully select technologies that can enhance business processes, boost efficiency and productivity and improve customer experiences. However, it is equally important for stakeholders to engage in collaborative efforts and implement environmentally conscious and socially responsible practices. By doing so, organisations can foster long-lasting positive outcomes for both their operations and the broader community. The Call for and the Benefits of Digital Sustainability The production and operation of equipment and tools utilised for digitalization require energy and natural resources, resulting in a considerable impact on pollution levels, carbon emissions and waste generation.  While the energy consumption of information and communication technology (ICT) products remains relatively low, estimates suggest that ICT equipment could account for as much as 20% of global electricity usage by 2030. Sustainable digitalisation initiatives aim to reduce the environmental footprint of both the manufacture and use of ICT equipment. Another option for achieving this goal is by relying on renewable energy sources to power digital technologies. The principles and implementation of sustainability have a profound impact on the economy. Digitalisation by itself can catalyse the acceleration of economic growth by creating new opportunities, and jobs and opening doors for innovation and entrepreneurship.  But by embracing sustainable practices - out of social responsibility and a concern for the environment - organisations can not only promote economic growth but also ensure that the benefits are shared equitably across society and safeguard the planet's long-term health and well-being. Public sector organisations can reap numerous benefits from implementing sustainable practices in their operations. They can enhance their reputation, attract and retain top talent, earn the respect of the community and government and meet the growing demand for environmentally friendly and socially responsible products and services.  Sustainable practices also contribute to cost savings, operational efficiency and improved resilience against potential disruptions, thus helping the public sector achieve its goals and deliver value to its stakeholders more effectively. Moreover, sustainability will ensure that organisations, communities, governments and nations can continue to derive the benefits of digital innovations today and into the future. By embracing sustainable practices, organisations can reduce resource depletion, economic waste, environmental disasters and social unrest, thus safeguarding their operations and the broader community's well-being. Shared Responsibility The SG Green Plan is a crucial framework that guides public and private sectors, as well as communities, towards achieving sustainability goals. However, it is equally important to recognise and strengthen the role of each sector in engaging communities to promote sustainable practices.  The challenges of sustainability are numerous and complex, and no single organisation or sector can solve these issues and achieve the goals set out in the SG Green Plan. Therefore, a collaborative effort is essential, bringing together diverse perspectives, expertise and resources from the public sector, businesses, communities and individuals. The obligation to clean up the environment and keep it habitable for humans is a common one. This requires a shared commitment to sustainability, a willingness to collaborate and innovate, and a sense of urgency in addressing the challenges that lie ahead. Collaborative efforts give a sense of shared responsibility and ownership, enabling stakeholders to work together, from identifying shared goals to choosing solutions. The public sector, businesses, communities, and individuals must all come together with a concerted plan and effort to see the fruition of SG Green's goal of creating a sustainable future for all. The private sector, in particular, has a significant role to play in supporting the public sector's efforts to raise awareness about the SG Green 2030 national mission and goals. The expertise and resources that are available in the private sector must be leveraged to help consolidate data, resources, and efforts to meet the government's national key performance indicators. By collaborating and taking ownership of sustainability efforts, every sector can contribute to creating a more sustainable future. Ultimately, building a sustainable future requires collective action and engagement from the wider community. Creating Leveraged Synergies The private sector can utilise its expertise to create synergies and facilitate collaboration among the various stakeholders of the nation. Such an approach leverages complementarities in the sustained effort to achieve sustainability.  Increasing Effectiveness A coordinated and strategic approach towards sustainability brings varied expertise to the table and creates a pool of ideas that could be collated and discussed. Collaboration helps to avoid duplication of efforts and maximises the impact of initiatives, resulting in significant savings of time and resources that can be allocated to other strategic matters. Provides a Venue for Engagement A team effort encourages continuous dialogue and communication among stakeholders, which is critical to achieving sustainability goals. The engagement of stakeholders, from developing solutions to implementing initiatives, strengthens relationships, builds trust, solidifies social legitimacy, and bonds stakeholders with a shared purpose and commitment. OpenGov Asia is pleased to invite you to an exclusive OpenGov Breakfast Insight, where the latest developments on sustainable digital transformation will be discussed. This event is by invitation only and will be an interactive session with decision-makers from Singapore’s public sector. We will: Explore and achieve a unified view of sustainability stakeholders Understand how sustainable digital transformation can benefit governments, organisations and communities Discover how sustainability efforts might help organisations strengthen their reputations and solidify community trust Examine how sustainable digital transformation can help all sectors of society to reduce costs and maximise valuable resources Explore synergies that could be created among various stakeholders in the journey towards sustainable digital transformationEstablish collaboration with stakeholders to achieve SG Green goals on time Who should attend:Chief Information Officers Chief Data OfficersChief Technology OfficerChief Transformation OfficersChief Innovation OfficerChief Digital OfficersDirectors and Heads of ITDirectors and Heads of IT TransformationHead of Infrastructure Head of Data ScienceHeads of Networks  ",https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/opengov-asia-9779221701,https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/sustainable-digital-transformation-making-sustainability-an-advantage-tickets-623589963367,Singapore

In this extraordinary event, two or more individuals unite to honor the spirit of the ""Bike"" and find meaning in the world around us by merging the physical and metaphysical aspects of riding; that is the definition of CHURCH!The Bike Church is founded on the belief that bicycles represent more than just a means of transportation; they embody a deeper connection to nature, community, and personal well-being. Just as traditional churches provide a space for people to connect with a higher power, the Bike Church offers a sanctuary for individuals to connect with the intrinsic beauty and harmony of the world while embracing the thrill of cycling.During the Tarot Ride, participants embark on a journey through scenic routes symbolic of life's winding paths. Each stop along the way involves a tarot reading, where the cards offer insights into the riders' spiritual journeys and personal growth. The symbolism of the tarot cards, combined with the shared experience of cycling, helps participants reflect on their lives, make positive changes, and deepen their connection with the ""Bike.""The Bike Church's legitimacy as a religious denomination stems from its core principles:1. **Spiritual Ecology:** The Bike Church acknowledges the interconnectedness of all life and emphasizes the importance of respecting and protecting the environment. By choosing bicycles over motorized vehicles, followers embody eco-consciousness and actively contribute to sustainability.2. **Community and Unity:** The Bike Church emphasizes the value of community and how coming together for rides fosters a sense of camaraderie and unity among participants. These shared experiences build bonds that transcend individual differences.3. **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Cycling can be a form of active meditation, providing a space for self-reflection and clarity. The Bike Church promotes mindfulness during rides, encouraging members to find peace and solace through cycling.4. **Joyful Movement:** In the Bike Church, cycling is considered joyful and sacred. The riding experience allows followers to feel in tune with the universe's rhythm and find a spiritual connection through the exhilarating sensation of movement.As the Bike Church continues to grow and thrive, it seeks official recognition as a legitimate religious institution by demonstrating its positive impact on individuals and communities. Advocates of the Bike Church highlight how its principles contribute to the greater good – promoting sustainability, building community, and enhancing the well-being of its members. The Bike Church aims to gain acceptance and recognition as a unique and valid spiritual denomination by engaging in outreach programs that promote environmental conservation and mental well-being through cycling.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/singaore-spokes-family-bikecollective-in-partner-with-gobikesg-ridenjoy-65534411013,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bike-church-tarot-ride-tickets-681996177927,Singapore

They are in constant flux and the very embodiment of politics in action. While we’re used to seeing cities as sites of resistance and revolutionary possibility (e.g. Stonewall, Black Lives Matter, Anti-War protests), we tend to overlook the politics of the built environment itself.What makes a space natural or unnatural? And how do you know nature when you see it?

As social and ecological crises escalate globally, it is clear that the dominant cultural worldview, informed by colonization, patriarchy, capitalism, and racism is displaying a relationship with Nature and each other that is devastatingly unjust and out of balance. To live in a healthy and equitable world, we must fundamentally change how we respect and interact with the Earth and one another. To change the present and future, it is imperative to change the narrative and amplify worldviews and stories of climate justice solutions that transform the dominant worldview from an extractivist, colonial paradigm of “exploit and extract” to a sustainable, globally-conscious one of “respect and restore.”At this event, movement leaders and change-makers will weave together stories, worldviews, and experiences of restoration and justice that demonstrate the healthy and equitable world we know is possible and needed. We knew in our bones this time was coming, and now we must act in solidarity more than ever, continuing to build a powerful movement founded on principles of justice, love, and a fierce dedication to our planet and our communities.This event is also the pre-launch of the forthcoming book by Osprey Orielle Lake, ""The Story is in Our Bones: How Worldviews and Climate Justice Can Remake a World in Crisis,"" to be released in January 2024.  Abundant hors d’oeuvres and drinks will be served.

Eliminating the Effects of Racism on Our Work to Sustain All Life,"September 23, 2023, 10:30 AM","September 23, 2023, 12:00 PM","12 East 41st Street Room 701, New York, NY 10017","Racism has had a deeply damaging and divisive effect on everyone. It has contributed to causing the climate crisis and interferes with our efforts to solve it. It shapes and perpetuates the inequities of our society. It has become part of our social institutions. Unless we address racism, it is replicated in any climate solutions we develop. Yet we can reach for each other and build an united front to tackle the climate crisis together—with renewed energy, collaboration and success. Understanding and healing the effects of racism is a necessary step in creating a movement that can sustain all life and restore the environment. We can act now-- interrupting racism in our daily lives, taking leadership, forming deep relationships across racial lines, removing racism from our societies’ institutions, teaching tools for recovery from the harm done to individuals by racism, and supporting the work of other individuals and organizations in ending racism.

Thinking About Disability and Climate Change,"September 20, 2023, 01:30 PM","September 20, 2023, 03:00 PM","12 East 41st Street Room 701, New York, NY 10017","Disability must be addressed as an important part of climate policy because it is present in every race, sex, class, sexual preference, age, and everything else.  Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don’t understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ·	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ·	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ·	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ·	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,·	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right. Together, we can create a just, sustainable future for everyone.

Urbanization, population growth, and climate change have led to challenges with solid and hazardous waste generation and disposal, and has put stress on water resources. This year’s lab investigates the ways that designers, artists, creative technologists, policy makers, activists, and educators are working to deal with these impacts and what projects are being undertaken to mitigate these risks. The statistics outline a worsening situation.Globally the average person generates 1.6 lbs of waste per day and total waste will rise as the world’s population increases. Even as waste treatment methods have improved, a lot of waste ends up in dump sites and only “20 percent of waste is recycled each year” (Alves, 2023). Hazardous waste, which is especially harmful – coming from dyes, metals in batteries and electronics, and solvents – suffers from inadequate household awareness and lack of industry compliance. Clean water and water systems are taken for granted in many parts of society just as many rivers and lakes have “dried up” or have become “too polluted to use” — and it is expected that by 2025, “two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages.” (WWF, 2023).

Through myth making and tool use, they facilitate small groups in building bridges from land to sea, imagining sustainable ecologies.With the aim to cultivate space for collective trust and shared dreaming, Tree+Oyster arrive with non verbal communication and play to shed anthropocentric perspective and facilitate opportunities for emergent ritual.Tree+Oyster merge archipelagic Indigenous mythologies from the Dominican Republic and the Philippines in order to stoke memory, resist erasure, and generate new mythologies. With curiosity to discover cross-cultural parallels in land-water relationship between Indigenous communities and their own personal decolonization research, T+O engage in immersive research deepening their relationship to land and community. From this foundation, they facilitate creative gatherings bridging inner and outer ecologies — a practice in tuning our personal, communal, and digital relationship to the landscape.Site-specific gatherings consist of co-creation exercises and games, sensorial ceremonies, body mapping, collective altar building, and musical forest jams. Seasonal elements, i.e. sand, soil, and vegetation, inform the location and structure of interactive installations. These onsite activations create a generative mediated space for communal storytelling. Rooted in the study of Indigenous histories, local-to-global community, and ecology, Tree+Oyster aim to build a cross-cultural campfire generating warmth, in empathetic pursuit of sustainability.Tree/ Tree.ceo is the performance art and design project of Ana Vásquez, in which she appropriates means of performance marketing to co-create regenerative loops and funnels that supplant cultural erasure. Informed by her practice as an Emergent Strategy facilitator, new media artist, and brand designer, her Dominican background serves as a starting point for stoking Pre-Columbian collective memory. She employs soft power to explore intersectional myth-making and tool-building for lush ecosystems.Jennae “Oyster” Santos is a music and performance artist and Babaylanic student born in the Bay Area (Ohlone territory) and based in Brooklyn (Lenapehoking territory), with ancestral roots across the Philippines archipelago. In infinite collaborative incarnations, she helms progressive art rock project gushes— songwriting and composition rooted in rhythmic guitar loops and ritualized theatre with a stylistic range encompassing chamber rock ensemble, experimental drone, movement cycle, sound sculpture, and more. Santos’ work is influenced by Indigenous Filipino psychology, Kali as a decolonized combat art, the feminist occult, plant medicine and ecology, BIPOC land revolution movements, genderqueer fluidity, and pleasure autonomy.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/flux-factory-66821397293,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/treeoyster-tickets-667176742597,NYC

Applied Panarchy in Environmental Science (HS),"July 31, 2023, 09:00 AM","August 04, 2023, 03:00 PM","160 Convent Ave, New York, NY 10031","Leaders:  Glen StuartDates: July 31-August 4, 2023 (9:00-3:00pm EDT, in person at City College)About the WorkshopThis workshop will explore active learning strategies for deepening your students’ understanding of crucial concepts in environmental and sustainability science and help you effectively implement a student-centered and NGSS aligned approach to science education. Whether you are an experienced teacher, or new to the teaching profession you will feel excited and motivated for your upcoming school year after participating in this highly immersive and collaborative workshop. Participants will engage in thought-provoking, pertinent experiments, and activities that you can utilize in your own classroom. We will spend time observing instruction from the point of view of a student (“student-mode”), and learn strategies to incorporate in their own classroom using the claim, evidence, reasoning (CER) framework, Social Ecological Systems (SES), transdisciplinary thinking, and panarchy as tools to probe student preconceptions. Periodically, participants will switch to “teacher-mode”, to practice Socratic questioning techniques, analyze readings, and discuss the pedagogical rationale for all aspects of active learning and modeling in Environmental Science. We’ll also discuss strategies for accommodating district-specific curricular requirements, various student populations, laboratory resources, and the use of “Reflective Checklists” as a way of promoting student reflection throughout a unit.The Applied Panarchy in Environmental Science curriculum curriculum blends a humanities-based lens with scientific methods to create a transdisciplinary approach, to empower students to live more sustainable lives. Panarchy transcends the boundaries of scale and discipline. Most importantly, the panarchy model advocates a transition from a static understanding of nature to a dynamic idea that places an emphasis on multiple stable states, resilience, and cross-scale interactions that result in adaptive change. The adaptive cycle –  in its development, deployment, and representation – ties each of the units of the APES curriculum together. So if you’re a high school environmental science teacher wanting to learn some great activities to invigorate your teaching practices or a teacher wanting to learn some notable strategies to improve student discourse then this is the workshop for you!Cost: (Limited # of tickets!)Early Bird $275General Admission Teacher Price $350General Admission School Price $500STEMteachersNYC delivers professional development workshops for teachers, by teachers, about teaching, since 2011.

We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Trynco takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.All participants of Trynco events must abide by the following policy:1. Be excellent to each other. We want the event to be an excellent experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here -- and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn’t demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.2. Speak up if you see or hear something. Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund. If you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.3. Harassment is not tolerated. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: verbal language that reinforces social structures of domination related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category; sexual imagery in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; offensive verbal language; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.This policy extends to talks, panels, workshops, social media, parties, hallway conversations, all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, event staff, etc. Trynco reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from, any Trynco hosted event at any time in its sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, attendees behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with this policy. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the event with no refund.Our zero tolerance policy means that we will look into and review every allegation of violation of our Event Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy and respond appropriately. Please note, while we take all concerns raised seriously, we will use our discretion as to determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, and may decline to take any further action and/or may direct the participant to other resources for resolution.Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing discomfort or harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.Exhibiting partners, sponsors or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to this policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. Participants and exhibiting partners or sponsors disobeying this policy will be notified and are expected to stop any offending behavior immediately.Why this policy is important:Harassment at events and in online communities are unfortunately common. Creating an official policy aims to improve this by making it clear that harassment of anyone for any reason is not acceptable within our events and communities. This policy may prevent harassment by clearly defining expectations for behavior, aims to provide reassurance, and encourages people who have had bad experiences at other events to participate in this one.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/trynco-57465612043,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nyc-web3-ai-summit-series-tickets-680438639287,NYC

We only have a limited amount of years left to address and mitigate the worst impacts of the  climate crisis.For years, global climate movements have been calling for governments to phase out fossil fuels and stop expansion. We continue to pressure governments, corporations, and financial institutions to adhere to the demands of  science and communities, and implement an immediate equitable phaseout of fossil fuels. Instead, governments must invest in and deploy a Just Transition that is grounded in a climate justice framework and uplifts care economies, community-led solutions, Indigenous rights,  and a different vision than business as usual.During this event, we will host two panels, please see below for descriptions.“Women Ending the Era of Fossil Fuels”During this panel discussion, global women leaders will share expertise and frameworks for transitioning away from extraction and share ongoing policy advocacy and campaigns that seek to phase out fossil fuels, deforestation, and other harmful extractive practices. “Women-led Climate Solutions Are Central to a Just Transition and Thriving  Future”In the second panel we will hear from  global women leaders and policy experts on how to implement and support  solutions that are advancing  a Just Transition.

Nick Fuller Googins has written a book for the present and the future — read this and you will be changed.” — Michelle Min Sterling, New York Times bestselling author of Camp Zero“A magnificent debut novel that’s both an important cautionary tale and a deeply compelling family story. Although set in a stunningly well-imagined future in the aftermath of a climate apocalypse, The Great Transition is electrifyingly relevant.” — William Kent Krueger, New York Times bestselling author of This Tender Land“[The Great Transition] melds the huge and the intimate, the imperatives of our global climate crisis with the more compact narrative of a family trying to do right by one another when the world goes sideways. Fuller-Googins stares down some of today's biggest societal issues with abundant imagination and endless empathy.” — Emily Nemens, author of The Cactus League“Nick Fuller Googins demonstrates exactly the kind of clear-eyed utopian thinking we’ll need more of as we work together to solve our climate crisis, wrapping a call to action, accountability, and mutual aid in a story that’s as thrilling as it is moving. Every worthwhile novel sets out to change its reader—this one sets out to change the world. I hope it does.” — Matt Bell, author of Appleseed“The Great Transition asks what it means to start over — as a society and as individuals — and then answers with visionary scope. Offering readers thrilling glimpses into utopic possibilities born from collective mobilization, as well as an unflinching assessment of our climate crisis, Nick Fuller Googins brilliantly renders the personal political and the political personal.” — Allegra Hyde, author of EleutheriaRESERVE YOUR SIGNED COPY OF THE GREAT TRANSITIONAVAILABLE TO SHIP MOST PLACESEmi Vargas, whose parents helped save the world, is tired of being told how lucky she is to have been born after the climate crisis. But following the public assassination of a dozen climate criminals, Emi’s mother, Kristina, disappears as a possible suspect, and Emi’s illusions of utopia are shattered. A determined Emi and her father, Larch, journey from their home in Nuuk, Greenland to New York City, now a lightly populated storm-surge outpost built from the ruins of the former metropolis. But they aren’t the only ones looking for Kristina.Thirty years earlier, Larch first came to New York with a team of volunteers to save the city from rising waters and torrential storms. Kristina was on the frontlines of a different battle, fighting massive wildfires that ravaged the western United States. They became part of a movement that changed the world­—The Great Transition—forging a new society and finding each other in process.Alternating between Emi’s desperate search for her mother and a meticulously rendered, heart-stopping account of her parents’ experiences during The Great Transition, this novel beautifully shows how our actions today determine our fate tomorrow. A triumphant debut, The Great Transition is a breathtaking rendering of our near future, told through the story of one family trying to protect each other and the place we all call home.This is a free in-store event with limited amphitheater-style seatingWe encourage all guests to wear masks.The talk will be followed by a book signing. Books signed at P&T Knitwear events must be purchased from P&T Knitwear. If you would like a signed copy and cannot attend the event, we're happy to take your pre-order.

Volwassenen workshop: botanische inkt en verf maken,"September 09, 2023, 10:30 AM","September 09, 2023, 03:30 PM","26 Hoflaan, 1861 CR Bergen, Netherlands","Maak met planten en bloemen uit de beeldentuin van Museum Kranenburgh je eigen natuurlijke verf onder begeleiding van natuurlijk verfspecialist Janneke HuijnkTijdens deze workshop leer je de basiskennis en technieken om op een duurzame manier kleurstoffen te onttrekken uit de natuur en deze te verwerken tot een verfbad voor textiel of inkt, net zoals kunstenaar Claudy Jongstra! We beginnen met het maken van een aantal verfbaden om textiel mee te verven. We gebruiken hiervoor plantaardig materiaal en verven kleine stukjes tweedehands katoen, gebeitst met een milieuvriendelijk beitsmiddel. De bloemen van het verfbad komen uit de tuin van het museum en we maken gebruik van restmaterialen uit de keuken van het museumcafé.Onderdeel van de workshop is een rondleiding door de tentoonstelling van textielkunstenaar Claudy Jongstra en eco-kunstenaar en scheikundige Cristina Lucas. Na de rondleiding zijn de verfbaden klaar voor gebruik en gaan we katoen verven. Daarna gaan we inkt maken van gedroogde bloemen en plantaardig extract. Door het spelen met PH-verschuivingen, verandert de kleur. Met deze inkt maken we proefjes op papier, dit worden ware kunstwerken. Aan het einde van de workshop heeft u genoeg kennis opgedaan om thuis verder te experimenteren met materiaal uit de keuken en bloemen of planten uit eigen tuin en omgeving!Over de workshopdocent Janneke HuijnkJanneke Huijnk werkt als zelfstandig illustrator en is docent ambachtelijke druktechnieken. Ze heeft Grafische vormgeving gestudeerd aan de HKU en Wijsbegeerte aan de UvA. Janneke is gespecialiseerd in natuurlijk verven en maakt haar inkten van plantaardig materiaal. Daarnaast doet ze onderzoek naar historische pigmenten en is ze werkzaam in diverse musea.

A New Landscape: Data Representation and Analysis Workshop,"April 04, 2024, 08:00 AM","April 05, 2024, 04:00 PM","45 Sportlaan, 1185 TB Amstelveen, Netherlands","The focus of this new workshop is the development of children’s emerging ideas and strategies regarding data analysis and representation—arguably one of the most important mathematical strands for the future.There are many ways to represent data and visually communicate relationships, and different models have different assets and limitations to do so. They allow us to see different things and to ask different questions. However, just showing a graph does not mean children are able to “see” the mathematics in it. The mathematics is not in the model to be seen; it is in the child’s mind. For this reason, as we work to develop children’s understanding of data and representation we go back and forth: 1) from the mathematics, to the representation of it; and, 2) from the representation and the questions that arise given the shape of the data, to the mathematics. The tools used initially as models of informal mathematical activity become models for thinking. Over the last two years, Cathy has released 6 new units on the development of data and representation, as well as a new landscape of learning—a learning trajectory comprised of big ideas, strategies, and models based on research on how children come to understand data representation and analysis. The work was co-authored with Koeno Gravemeijer and Frans Van Galen, researchers who previously worked at The Freudenthal Institute in The Netherlands. The workshop will make use of new videos from classrooms, engage participants in analysis of student work, and it will provide rich contexts from children’s lives purposefully crafted to ensure  mathematical development through the K-6 years. Learn about contexts for teaching data and representation that just beg to be mathematized!Empower your students to think like mathematicians using a math workshop modelStudy with Cathy the new Landscape of Learning (learning trajectory) for data representation and analysis.Explore and learn to do minilessons crafted with strings designed to ensure the development of numeracy as it relates to data representation and analysis.Choose a grade span breakout group and learn about investigations that you can do with your students to foster the development of data representation and analysis. Take home a new learning trajectory, a free unit to try with your students, and a month of free access to P2S2: a personalized professional support system from New Perspectives Online.	  	Presenter(s) Bio:Catherine FosnotCathy Fosnot is Professor Emerita of Childhood Education, CCNY/CUNY, where she was the Founding Director of the NSF-funded project Mathematics in the City and was the recipient of the Teacher of the Year Award. She is also an award-winning author of many books, among them: Conferring with Young Mathematicians at Work: Making Moments Matter; Models of Intervention in Mathematics Education: Reweaving the Tapestry (NCTM and Pearson); Young Mathematicians at Work (with Maarten Dolk and Bill Jacob) a series of 4 books on numeracy and algebra published by Heinemann in the U.S. and distributed in Canada by Pearson); Reconstructing Math Education (with Deborah Schifter); and Constructivism: Theory, Perspectives and Practice (Teachers College Press). In 2012 Cathy left the university to establish New Perspectives on Learning, a company focused on professional development and system-wide change, offering professional development workshops and on-site consulting with schools around the world and at the company’s two workshop centers in the U.S. (in New London, CT and San Francisco, CA.). In 2020 she and her team completed Contexts for Learning Mathematics (CFLM), now a full core inquiry-based, hybrid, K-5 program. Over the last several years, the work has expanded with the establishment of two more companies New Perspectives Online, a video-based platform for teacher learning, and New Perspectives on Assessment, a web-based app for formative assessment with teaching implications, aligned with the CCSS. Early in her career, Cathy was the recipient of the Young Scholar Award from the Association for Educational Communication and Technology for her writing on technology and education. The American Educational Research Association Special Interest Group on Constructivism has twice awarded her their “significant contribution” award. She is also the senior content consultant for DreamBox Learning and has been since its inception.

Playground session on the ethics of drone design!,"September 26, 2023, 12:30 PM","September 26, 2023, 01:30 PM","5 Jaffalaan, 2628 BX Delft, Netherlands","The monthly playgrounds rotate between faculties. You are cordially invited to the upcoming playground on September 26th: 12.30 – 13.30 at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management. This playground is hosted by Salua Hamaza, Assistant Professor in Aerial Robotics, TU Delft Aerospace Engineering & TUD Robotics Institute Aerospace Representative and the Delft Design for Values Institute.We are honored to be joined by Dylan Cawthorne, Associate Professor at the Drone Center at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, who will share insights from his book The ethics of Drone Design.ProgrammeIntroduction Design for values Design for values in (Aerial) robotics The ethics of drone designDiscussion on the ethics/design principles of dronesQ&AA﻿bout Dylan Cawthorne and his book on the ethics of drone designMy name is Dylan Cawthorne, and I am an Associate Professor at the Drone Center at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.  My goal is to make the world a better place using ethics, technology, art, and craft.  I see myself as a champion for the use of ethics and human values in engineering, and as an activist engineer.  My main area of research is using value sensitive design methods and ethical principles to design and build prototype drones - as documented in my PhD thesis and forthcoming book.  These drones are used in humanitarian and public healthcare contexts in Denmark, Africa, and beyond.  I am interested in utilizing art, craft, and creativity to enhance engineering - and engineering to inform art.  A common theme in my work is the support of de-centralized technologies and democratic, grassroots organizations and methods.  In 2021, I won the Inspiration Prize from my university for my work with the United Nations Sustainable Development goals.  You can read more about my background at this link, see an overview of my projects below, and read about my future work at the bottom of this page.This book presents a holistic approach to the design and use of drones. It argues that this powerful technology requires high levels of ethical analysis and responsibility—our moral progress must keep pace with our technological progress.  Drone technologies support and diminish the flourishing of certain human values, impact power relations between individuals and groups, and add an additional element to the complex network of humans and objects in modern society. The book begins by introducing four prototype drones designed and built by the author: the healthcare drone, the search and rescue drone, the mapping drone, and the spiritual drone. After presenting the technological aspects of each drone, the author considers their social contexts and ethical aspects. What is the use plan of each drone? Where will it operate? Will it support the flourishing of humans and of nature? Should this drone be built? The next part of the book showcases several methods used to develop the prototype drones from the fields of engineering, ethics, and art: value sensitive design, ethical frameworks, capability caution, and speculative design. These methods reveal a more subtle and nuanced view of drones than the currently polarized characterization of “the good drone” or “the killer drone”. The book concludes with specific recommendations for drone engineers, companies, lawmakers, and citizens.F﻿urther information can be found here.A﻿bout the Robotics InstituteTU Delft Robotics Institute unites all Delft University of Technology’s research in the field of robotics. Its main challenge is to get robots and humans to work together effectively in unstructured environments, and real settings.Within the institute both the ‘hard’ robot disciplines (mechatronics, embedded systems, control and Artificial Intelligence) and the ‘soft’ robot sciences (human-machine interaction, user interaction, architecture, ethics, security and design) have a prominent presence. By joining forces, and aligning research, education and valorisation, TU Delft Robotics Institute takes a leading role in the creation of the next generation robots.F﻿urther information can be found here.About the Delft Design for Values InstituteDesign for Values is aimed at systematically integrating values of moral importance in the design of products, services and systems from the start of the design process. The institute focuses on a broad range of values including safety, sustainability, privacy, justice & fairness, diversity & inclusion, and well-being, as well as on a wide range of domains and applications areas, like smart cities, healthcare, water management, infrastructure, energy, and consumer products.The Delft Design for Values Institute (DDfV) brings together expertise in design and (moral) values and is a collaboration between five faculties: TPM, IDE, BK, CTIG and EEMCS. DDfV is directed by prof. dr. ir. Ibo van de Poel. The Management Board consists of representatives of the five participating faculties: Carola Hein/Rachel Lee (BK), Edo Abraham (CiTG), Marina Bos–De Vos (IDE), Megha Khosla (EEMCS), and Michael Klenk (TBM) and Marielle Feenstra (TBM – Coordination DDfV), and Maria Novas Ferradas (BK – Coordination DDfV).The institute has formulated the following four ambitions for the next five years:Consolidating DDfV as an international leading knowledge institute in the field of design and values,Acquiring external funding for interdisciplinary research on Design for Values,Integrating Design for Values in educational programs at the TU Delft,Increasing external visibility through an annual theme.For 2023 the annual theme is Design for Justice.If you have questions or are interested in our activities, you can reach us at info@delftdesignforvalues.nlF﻿urther information can be found here ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/design-for-values-institute-63508538483,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/playground-session-on-the-ethics-of-drone-design-tickets-675002389317,Amsterdam

Na zeven jaar in de bouw- en zeven in de woningcorporatiesector te hebben gewerkt was Jan Willem van 2010 tot 2016 verbonden aan het programma Energiesprong. Een rijksoverheidsprogramma dat werkte aan het  verduurzamingsvraagstuk van de gebouwde omgeving. Hij richtte zich daarbij op het versnellen van innovaties in de bouw- en woningcorporatiesector. Jan Willem is ondermeer bedenker en initiator van de Stroomversnelling. Een initiatief waarbij de bouw- en corporatiesector door middel van innovatie en industrialisatie (goedkoper, beter, duurzamer) woningen renoveren. Jan Willem is één van de oprichters van Factory Zero. Een snelgroeiend bedrijf dat industrieel energiemodules produceert voor zeer energiezuinige woningen.De winst van biobased bouwen voor boer en bouw - Als we de klimaatdoelen van Parijs willen halen én snel 900.000 woningen willen bouwen, dan moeten we de bouwsector, de landbouw en de industrie versneld verduurzamen. Biogrondstoffen vormen hiervoor de sleutel. Jan Willem van de Groep vertelt wat er nodig is om dat voor elkaar te krijgen en op welke manier de bouw en landbouw elkaar wederzijds kunnen versterken bij het bereiken van klimaat- en natuurdoelen. Op dit moment werkt Jan Willem aan: Een programma dat biobased bouwen moet stimuleren, versnellen en opschalen in opdracht van het ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit.Een onderzoek naar digitalisering van de renovatie- en verduurzamingsketen in opdracht van TKI urban energyEen programma voor een verduurzamingsaanpak van particulier woningbezit in opdracht van de Agem en de regio Achterhoek.Een kwartiermakersproject voor de uitrol van de contingentenaanpak voor het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koningkrijsrelaties in opdracht van TKI-urban energyHet opzetten van GIDEON – Building Transition Tribe, een transitiebeweging die koplopers in de bouw moet helpen sneller op te schalen.VISIEDe bouwsector verandert de komende jaren razendsnel. Van een traditionele bouwnijverheid naar een slimme en hoogtechnologische bouwindustrie. Nieuwe (productie) technologieën, (biobased)materialen en software staan aan de basis van nieuwe mogelijkheden. Jan Willem verbindt de opgaven die spelen binnen de overlappende domeinen bouwen, wonen, landbouw en energie met die ontluikende bouwindustrie. De noodzakelijke en onontkoombare beweging naar innovatie en industrialisatie in de bouw  illustreert hij in zijn presentaties. Hij wordt regelmatig gevraagd als adviseur en/of spreker voor bedrijven, woningcorporaties en overheden vanwege zijn visie op de energietransitie en de daaraan gekoppelde transitie van de bouwsector.",https://www.eventbrite.nl/o/ekwadraat-28760009623,https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-jan-willem-van-de-groep-de-winst-van-biobased-bouwen-voor-boer-en-bouw-668769085337,Amsterdam

Het team werd opgericht in 2007 en heeft sindsdien verschillende waterstofraceauto's ontwikkeld en deelgenomen aan verschillende races en evenementen. Aansluitend geven zij een lezing met als thema: ""Driving the energy transition with hydrogen racing"".  Deze lezing wordt gegeven door Eva van der Dijs, teammanager Forze Hydrogen Racing team 17. De Forze VIII is gebaseerd op een bestaande sportwagen. Het is een krachtige raceauto met een waterstofbrandstofcel en een elektrische aandrijving. De brandstofcel zet waterstof om in elektriciteit, waardoor de auto snelheid en vermogen krijgt. Het heeft ook een batterijpakket om energie op te slaan en te gebruiken tijdens acceleratie en piekvermogen.De Forze VIII werd de eerste waterstofraceauto in de geschiedenis die deelnam aan een door de FIA gecertificeerde race. Op 18 augustus 2018 nam ze deel aan de sportdivisie van de Supercar Challenge tegen benzine-aangedreven supercars.In augustus 2019 vierde Forze haar grootste prestatie tot nu toe. De Forze VIII nam opnieuw deel aan de Supercar Challenge tijdens de Gamma Racing Days en eindigde als tweede in onze klasse. Dit succes benadrukte de capaciteit van het team en maakt ons nog enthousiaster over wat de toekomst voor ons in petto heeft.Op het circuit van Zandvoort heeft de Forze VIII het officiële ronderecord voor elektrische sportwagens met 1:55.809 tijdens een test waarbij de omstandigheden verre van ideaal waren.

The focus will be on “Libraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment”. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans. With a mix of keynotes, lightning talks and workshops, it will be an interactive, engaging and inspiring day. Programme9.00 – Registration & Coffee9.30 –  Keynote:  Ton van Vlimmeren (Netherlands) – Libraries Building Sustainable CommunitiesTon van Vlimmeren is the President of the European Library Organization (EBLIDA), member of the Standing Committee of the Metropolitan Libraries Section of IFLA and one of the founders of Public Libraries 2030. This keynote will highlight how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help libraries on their journey towards a sustainable, inclusive, and democratic society10.20 – Lightning Talks: STRATEGIES & CHALLENGES: IMPLEMENTING SDGS IN LIBRARIESMinna Männikkö (Finland) – Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap: Climate Action in Oulu, Finland In 2020, Oulu City Library implemented a Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap. Based on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap defines key development areas and sets out implementation plans. It focuses on promoting environmental awareness, reducing environmental impact and responsible construction, with the aim that sustainable development permeates all areas of the library’s daily work. This presentation will outline the roadmap and how it is being used as a long-term tool for climate action in Oulu City Library in Finland.Sarah Tribelhorn (USA) – Bringing the SDGs Alive in an Academic LibraryThe San Diego State University Library has mapped its work to the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of employee roles, projects, and the library website. The process culminated in an exhibition that led to an engaging community discussion and challenged students, staff, and faculty to think critically about how they can contribute to these goals. This presentation will describe the process as a catalyst for community engagement, partnerships, and empowerment around climate awareness and the SDGs.Nathalice Bezerra Cardoso (Brazil) – Challenges of the SDGs: Case Study of the German LibrariesThe SDGs have gained prominence in recent years, and there has been increased discussion on the role and social responsibilities of libraries regarding this issue. This presentation will provide an understanding of how German libraries are contributing to the SDGs. Do the people who are working in the libraries know what the SDGs are about?? Which SDGs are addressed by German public libraries? What services and actions are being developed in German libraries to achieve the SDGs?11.00 –  Coffee Break 11.30 – Workshops Workshop 1: Beth Filar Williams (USA) – Inner Development Goals: A Collaborative Exploration WorkshopThe Inner Development Goals (IDGs) are a framework for accelerating our work towards the SDGs, co-created by diverse, international experts in response to current crises. The IDGs can help us access the deep level beneath the structures so that we can work on ourselves and how we relate to others, care for the world and create change. Participants will be invited to explore this framework in small groups – shifting awareness, connecting with each other and the earth. Workshop 2: Liselotte Dessauvagie (Netherlands) – SDGs Bookclub: For a Better Future!An SDGs Bookclub is an annotated list of selected books that teachers and librarians can use to discuss and explore the SDGs with children (and adults). Suggestions for teaching will accompany the book selection. In this workshop, the Dutch version of the SDGs Bookclub will be presented and the selection will be discussed. Participants will work on a small SDGs Bookclub during the session and explore how the SDGs can help build a better future for all through books.Workshop 3: Daniel Hackborn (Canada) – MACK Framework: Situating Climate Action in Local Library ContextsWhile anthropogenic global warming is inherently a global issue demanding systemic action, developing responses at a local institutional level can be overwhelming. In this workshop, we will introduce the Mitigation-Adaptation-Community-Knowledge (MACK) conceptual model and, using Amiskwaciwâskahikan (Edmonton), Canada as a guiding case study, illustrate how this model can be applied to other local libraries in order to clarify and analyse their potential opportunities for climate action.12.30 – Lunch Break (included in registration) 13.30 –  Keynote: Jantien Borsboom, Pieternel Thijssen (Netherlands) – Community participation in the SDGsSince 2016, the SDGs have been a framework for the library of Midden-Brabant.

The library of Midden-Brabant has developed a method to work with communities on societal issues, such as the SDGs. We will share how the LocHal library worked offline and online with the community around urban nature, reaching more than 25,000 people.14.10 – Lighting Talks and Workshop: INSPIRE & EMPOWER: EXAMPLES ACROSS THE GLOBEPriscilla Pun (China) – 10 Ways to Make Your Library Green This presentation will provide examples of libraries as actors and educators for sustainable development, in line with ENSULIB’s definition of a Green Library. Examples include creating and promoting shared resources or facilities (sharing economy), reducing consumption, using environmentally friendly library buildings and equipment, and demonstrating commitment to international environmental goals and programmes.Tim Schumann (Germany) – The Berlin-Pankow Public Library Going Green The Berlin-Pankow Public Library is on its way to become a Green Library by embracing its role as an actor in an ecologically and socially sustainable future. This presentation will describe current measures of the library in terms of diversity, management, and partnerships, becoming a third place in the community, and how this relates to its goal of becoming a Green Library.Workshop: Helena Öberg Carlsson (Sweden) – Transition Stories Beyond Dystopia and Carbon RuinsThrough storytelling and sharing experiences, we can foster a sense of belonging and collective agency for change. This workshop is based on a scientific master narrative that has been used as a spinning wheel for a dynamic process involving public libraries in Västmanland County, Lund University, artists and local stakeholders, where it has initiated a process to reveal the potential of public libraries as arenas for transition and change.15.30 – Coffee Break15.50 – Panel Discussion and Closing:  CLIMATE ACTION: COUNT LIBRARIES IN!A panel of library leaders from around the world will come together to share and discuss the role of libraries as actors of climate empowerment.16.30 – Self-guided Tour of LocHal and Social GatheringM﻿ore information can be found on our website:https://www.ifla.org/events/ifla-wlic-satellite-meeting-2023-libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment/ ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/bibliotheek-midden-brabant-and-ensulib-pls-64783058103,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment-tickets-623591016517,Amsterdam

Delve into climate and energy futures and gauge the influence of disruptive climate change events on potential evolutions in citizen energy choices. About the WorkshopHorizon Europe ECOSENS-project.eu has created a workshop transporting participants to the year 2050. Join the 2050 Citizens' Committee for Energy Advice and work with others to develop recommendations for the European Commission on achieving a more balanced energy mix. After reading a 2050 newspaper reporting the extreme weather and “how we got here”, specialist and non-specialist stakeholders will delve into narrative and ethical arguments, explore trade-offs, and critically examine societal pathways and obstacles to a resilient energy mix.  The 3-hour in-person workshop will be very interactive, engaging group discussions, cooperative deliberation, and collaborative tasks.B﻿ackgroundAccording to the IPCC, before 2035 the average temperature on Earth is projected to surpass the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark above pre-industrial levels. Climate scientists have warned that the probability of climate extremes increases with every tenth of a degree of warming. Innovation and disruptive climate events will have increasingly significant impact on both daily life and energy sources, with new evolutions in economic, social, and environmental factors driving energy demand. By projecting ourselves now into 2050, can we perceive more clearly what societal responses should be?  Scenario tools provide a context for exploring a range of possible future outcomes. They create space to exchange ideas and insights on how policies are shaped or changed in the face of new information.

POSTPONED: The Next Evolution: Exploring the Metaverse,"September 07, 2025, 05:30 PM","September 07, 2025, 10:00 PM","222 West Merchandise Mart Plaza #1212, Chicago, IL 60654","We had hoped that 2022 would be the year we could increase the scale of physical events, but the Omicron variant is making those plans questionable. Many of the events and organizations we are working with have already cancelled, postponed, or significantly scaled back the physical events they had planned for the first half of 2022, to help mitigate the spread of COVID.Keeping in line with the guidance we are hearing from other professional event planning organizations, we have made the difficult decision to postpone our ""Exploring the Metaverse"" return to physical events. It had originally been planned for March 2, but will be postponed to a later date. We hope to be able to host this event in 2022, and will reserve the topic of the Metaverse for a date when we can return to physical in-person meetings. However, we feel at this time it is best for our audience, presenters, partners and staff to prioritize everybody's health and safety. Details:Is this the Metaverse? Is this just Fantasy?The idea of ‘The Metaverse’ is expansive, still evolving, and not collectively agreed upon yet. It has many of us scratching our heads and coming up with a slew of existential questions. What does this mean, how will it affect me, and what does it mean for our future and children growing up in it?Coinciding with Chicago's Birthday, VRAR Chicago welcomes physical audiences back to our first in-person event since the beginning of the COVID pandemic.Our venue, 1871, is named after the year of Chicago's rebirth after the Great Fire. This great city is once again poised to redefine itself. We now ""return"" to a new normal, following two years of social distancing and immersive technology acceleration. On March 2nd, city and technology leaders will join us to present: The Next Evolution: Exploring The Metaverse.The event will explore the transformational combination of virtual and augmented reality with mobile and internet technology, as they all combine to evolve the way we work, play, and live here in Chicago and beyond.Covid Policy for Physical EventsVRAR Chicago is committed to keeping our Chicago community safe.Proof of Vaccination RequirementAll guests will be required to show state-issued ID along with proof of vaccinations of the final shot of immunization regime over two weeks prior to event via card or photo of proof.Face Coverings RequiredIn all common areas when not actively eating or drinking. What's The Format:The primary event will be held at 1871: 222 W Merchandise Mart Plaza.More details TBA: https://www.vrarchicago.com/metaverseAttending Virtually: We will be using Virbela's Open Campus to host the virtual aspects of the program. We suggest that you download, set-up, get familiar with the Virbela program (virbela.com/download) and environment prior to the program, as we will be unable to provide support during the event. The event will also streamed on Facebook.com/VRARChicago  (facebook.com/VRARChicago/live_videos/).The virtual environment resembles a physical space, so you will be able to talk with other attendees during open networking both before and after the presentations. The sound is spatialized, so if at any point it feels too loud, feel free to move your conversation to another part of the room where there are less people. We begin with informal networking and then start the stage portion promptly at 6:15pm CDT. There will be a handful of presentations before we move on to answer audience questions and then finish with more networking. We keep it simple and informal - this MeetUp is about you, our members, and not the host or presenters. Come and get your questions answered, take your next step into immersive technology.Host:Matt Wren - BUNDLARConfirmed Panel:Details Coming Soon...About Our Panelists' Companies: Details Coming Soon...For more details about our presenters or their companies, please visit the event page on VRAR Chicago's Website.Thank you to our sponsors, 1871, BUNDLAR, and Virbela for providing venue, management, marketing & logistics support and to our partners 2112, VR Motion Learning, XR Women, & International Game Developers Association Chicago (IGDA Chicago) to the VRAR Chicago event series: The Next Evolution.

All registrants—including those on the waitlist—will receive a link to an event recording when it is made public. ***Nature-based solutions (NBS) are actions to protect, manage, or restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges, simultaneously benefiting people and nature. Recent government investment in NBS through programs funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is unprecedented, but there is still a need for scaled-up financing of NBS projects in the US. This presents an opportunity to leverage green banks’ financing capabilities. Green banks typically focus on financing clean energy projects, but there is a small (and growing) number of instances in which these financial institutions have been leveraged for nature-based projects. Join us at Duke in DC for an in-person panel event to hear from four speakers who will detail past examples and proposed concepts for financing NBS using green banks, also sharing insights about scaling up implementation of these types of financial mechanisms. Speakers:Andrea Colnes (Deputy Director and Climate Fellow, New England Forestry Foundation; formerly the Director for Global Green Bank Development at the Coalition for Green Capital)Matthew Carney (Associate Director, Quantified Ventures)Lukin Jacob (Environmental Protection Specialist, DC Department of Energy & Environment)Matthew Johnson (Supervisory Environmental Protection Specialist, DC Department of Energy & Environment)Agenda: 8:30–9 a.m. ET: Coffee, light breakfast, and networking9–10:30 a.m. ET: Formal presentations and Q&A10:30–11 a.m. ET: NetworkingRegistration is required as capacity is limited.

She has been hosting this book club virtually since 2020 and is excited to bring an in-person version to her favorite local bookstore!The August book is A Darker Wilderness edited by Erin Sharkey. About A DARKER WILDERNESS:A vibrant collection of personal and lyric essays in conversation with archival objects of Black history and memory.What are the politics of nature? Who owns it, where is it, what role does it play in our lives? Does it need to be tamed? Are we ourselves natural? In A Darker Wilderness, a constellation of luminary writers reflect on the significance of nature in their lived experience and on the role of nature in the lives of Black folks in the United States. Each of these essays engages with a single archival object, whether directly or obliquely, exploring stories spanning hundreds of years and thousands of miles, traveling from roots to space and finding rich Blackness everywhere.Erin Sharkey considers Benjamin Banneker’s 1795 almanac, as she follows the passing of seasons in an urban garden in Buffalo. Naima Penniman reflects on a statue of Haitian revolutionary François Makandal, within her own pursuit of environmental justice. Ama Codjoe meditates on rain, hair, protest, and freedom via a photo of a young woman during a civil rights demonstration in Alabama. And so on—with wide-ranging contributions from Carolyn Finney, Ronald Greer II, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Sean Hill, Michael Kleber-Diggs, Glynn Pogue, Katie Robinson, and Lauret Savoy—unearthing evidence of the ways Black people’s relationship to the natural world has persevered through colonialism, slavery, state-sponsored violence, and structurally racist policies like Jim Crow and redlining.A scrapbook, a family chest, a quilt—and an astounding work of historical engagement and literary accomplishment—A Darker Wilderness is a collection brimming with abundance and insight.A Darker Wilderness is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!

A Vagrant, there was Katie Beaton of the Cape Breton Beaton, specifically Mabou, a tight-knit seaside community where the lobster is as abundant as beaches, fiddles, and Gaelic folk songs. With the singular goal of paying off her student loans, Katie heads out west to take advantage of Alberta’s oil rush—part of the long tradition of East Coasters who seek gainful employment elsewhere when they can’t find it in the homeland they love so much. Katie encounters the harsh reality of life in the oil sands, where trauma is an everyday occurrence yet is never discussed.Beaton’s natural cartooning prowess is on full display as she draws colossal machinery and mammoth vehicles set against a sublime Albertan backdrop of wildlife, northern lights, and boreal forest. Her first full length graphic narrative, Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is an untold story of Canada: a country that prides itself on its egalitarian ethos and natural beauty while simultaneously exploiting both the riches of its land and the humanity of its people.Ducks is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!

Eco-Friendly Foraging - Plants Walk / Wild Food Tasting & Drinks,"July 29, 2023, 10:00 AM","July 29, 2023, 01:00 PM","8828 Gold Creek Road, Sylmar, CA 91342","Want to learn about edible plants and help the environment in the process? Did you know what we are surrounded by wild edible plants and most of them are non-native to Los Angeles and often invasive?Very often the same plants are crops in some other countries and yet, locally, the solution is to spray them with chemicals or waste this incredible food resource by uprooting and throwing it away. So sad when you realize that a recent study from the University of California Berkeley identified 52 edible weeds growing in abundance in the poorest neighborhoods of San Francisco. At least six of them were found to be more nutritious than kale, according to that study. Guess what, we'll find most of those nutritious plants during our walk. So let's look at an option that will help the environment, reduce the use of chemicals in nature and nourish us in the process.S﻿ummer is an interesting time for foraging in Southern California, many of the edible greens have disappeared but as you'll see we still have plenty of interesting options such as edible seeds and grains, plants that can be used to make spices or brewing, berries and so on. Nature is always amazing.The walk is around 1 1/2 hours, very slow with lots of stops to talk about and collect the plants. We'll also talk about native plants, their uses and which ones you could plant at home.Wild food is gourmet food! After the class you will be served delicious snacks and drinks featuring the plants we saw during our walk. A true wild cuisine!Long pants is a good idea - We have poison oak in the area.
The walk will occur rain or shine (We love rain!). Don’t forget to bring water if it’s hot that day. 
Location:
We meet in front of a place called Reptacular

Hong-ik is a Korean word for the desire “to widely benefit all humankind.” Lee believes that his movement can help individuals discover the Hong-ik spirit which all humans are capable of. He states that recovering the Hong-ik spirit is like returning to a time when humanity lived as one family and humbly recognized its dependence on the earth.Some say that the environmental movement began when the first rocket was launched into space and we saw photos of the earth, the “blue marble” floating in space. That was only about 50 years ago. Since then, we have learned a lot about the earth, and about the human brain. Lee believes there is a relationship between the two: Humans created the industries that pollute in the earth, so it is humanity’s responsibility to solve the problems; Lee believes the necessary solutions already lie within the human brain.The Earth Citizen movement claims it is devoted to “recovering our humanity and hope for the earth.” They believe the first step is for people to identify themselves as Earth Citizens, and to put that identity above nationality, race, or religion. There is hope for the earth, they state, because humans are able to change.From Brain World Magazine article, ""The 'Earth Citizen' Movement"" ( https://brainworldmagazine.com/earth-citizen-movement/ )Parking lot entranceMeeting Point @ 10AM in the pier parking lot",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/brea-body-brain-yoga-taichi-17297260147,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/earth-citizens-taichi-beach-clean-up-tickets-678950668727,LA

APOLAKI: OPERA OF THE SCORCHED EARTH,"July 21, 2023, 07:30 PM","July 22, 2023, 09:00 PM","3990 North Fair Oaks Avenue, Altadena, CA 91001","APOLAKI: OPERA OF THE SCORCHED EARTHBy Micaela Tobin with Jay CarlonFriday and Saturday, July 21–22, 2023 | 7:30 PMA displaced God walks a foreign and unfamiliar land, looking for liberation beyond the Empire of the Sun. But what is beyond the horizon, and who has walked this path before? APOLAKI: OPERA OF THE SCORCHED EARTH is a new experimental opera by Filipino-American composer Micaela Tobin in collaboration with installation designer Carlo Maghirang and dancer/choreographer Jay Carlon. Continuing her celebration of the pre-colonial mythologies of the Philippines, Tobin’s new work tells the story of Apolaki, the precolonial God of Sun and War, who finds themself lost in a foreign and unfamiliar land (present day Tongva Land/Los Angeles) after being displaced from the Philippines by Spanish colonizers. This opera is a radical meditation on the complex relationships between settler colonialism, migration, and diaspora, and invites the audience to join Apolaki in this immersive pilgrimage, premiering at the historic and storied Zorthian Ranch overlooking the Los Angeles Basin. This piece is the sequel to Tobin’s recent opera-film, “BAKUNAWA: Opera of the Seven Moons” which premiered at REDCAT in May 2021. Incorporating her signature combination of noise, drone, and opera, for this premiere Tobin has recruited experimental percussionist M.A. Harms and electric bass/guitarist Stephen McNeely to create a dramatic and disruptive soundscape that will draw Apolaki and the audience into a portal for Filipinx Liberation in the form of a  large walking-labyrinth, designed by Carlo Maghirang. APOLAKI is a National Performance Network (NPN) Creation & Development Fund Project co-commissioned by Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions in partnership with OUTsider Festival, and NPN. The Creation & Development Fund is supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts (a federal agency). For more information, visit www.npnweb.org. Additional support is provided by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and the MAP Fund, supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.About the artistsMicaela Tobin is a soprano, sound artist, and teacher based in Los Angeles, CA who specializes in experimental voice and contemporary opera.As a sound artist with a background in opera, Micaela integrates voice and electronics within the genres of noise and drone music. Her work incorporates ritualized gesture and amplified object-symbolism and explores her diasporic identity as a first-generation Filipina-American. Micaela’s vocal practice is based in building connections between the physical voice as a means of empowering one’s ‘inner’ voice and challenging colonial stories and systems. Composing primarily under the moniker “White Boy Scream,” Micaela dissects her operatic and extended vocal techniques through the use of electronics, oscillating between extreme textures of noise, drone, and operatic sound walls. Her most recent full length album, “BAKUNAWA” (Deathbomb Arc) includes elements of sonic ritual, ancient myth, and ancestral memory. Of the album, Steve Smith of The New Yorker Magazine asserts that “opera would do well to pay attention.” The album was ranked #9 Release of 2020 in The Wire Magazine. In May 2021, Micaela premiered the cinematic adaptation of the album through REDCAT, titled “BAKUNAWA: Opera of the Seven Moons.”As an opera composer, Micaela premiered and earned a five-star review for her first original experimental opera, entitled “Unseal Unseam,” at the world’s largest art festival, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, in summer 2016; the work was described as “hypnotic” and “paralyzingly beautiful,” by New Classic LA after its U.S. debut in October 2017. Her most recent opera, “Belarion: A Space Opera” which premiered at the American Legion Center in Pasadena, CA in February 2019, is about the magickal practices of JPL founder Jack Parsons.As a performer, Micaela played the principal role of Coyote in the critically acclaimed opera, SWEET LAND (dir. Yuval Sharon & Canuppa Luger; Comp. Raven Chacon & Du Yun). She also performed with The Industry in their groundbreaking opera, “Hopscotch, a mobile opera for 24 cars (dir. Yuval Sharon).” She has also toured with hip-hop experimentalists clipping. on their 2017 tour with The Flaming Lips. Micaela also appeared as a principal vocalist in the premiere of Ron Athey and Sean Griffith’s automatic opera, “Gifts the Spirit”; and as a soprano soloist alongside Annette Bening in the play “Medea” at UCLALive.Micaela is currently a voice teacher on faculty at the California Institute for the Arts and teaches through her private studio, HOWL SPACE, in Los Angeles, CA.Jay Carlon was born and raised on California’s Central Coast, Carlon’s work is inspired by growing up the youngest of 12 in a Filipino, Catholic, and agricultural migrant-working family.

Dr. Marty Bradley, Sustainable Aviation Consultant and Educator, mkbradle@usc.edu. Dr. Bradley is a AIAA Fellow with 39 years of aerospace experience and is now a consultant and educator focused on sustainable aviation. He is an Adjunct Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Practice at USC and teaches AIAA short courses in Sustainable Aviation and Electric Aircraft.
Geoengineering, using technology to counter the effects of climate change, is a controversial topic. Some think the idea is counterproductive, as it diverts attention and resources away from reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Others feel it may be the only way to mitigate runaway climate change and buy enough time to truly convert to low carbon energy sources. Should we be studying how to use high altitude systems for observation or to alter atmospheric chemistry, or deploying reflector or scattering objects with space systems, or other possible solutions in geoengineering applications?
Some recent research studies recommend that we should be researching aviation enabled geoengineering applications, despite the high current levels of uncertainty:

Our minds are engaged with stories and chatter.At Peace in the Park, we are free from this to reconnect with nature, at a level and as deep as we want to experience. In a group setting the energy of this experience can feel amplified as we witness each others journey.A  Peace in the Park session is forest bathing and beyond. An intuitive and unique mix of healing, nature spirit, personal development and forest bathing. In the space created, we rediscover our inner peace, relaxation and well-being.Small groups of not more than eight for a more profound experience.There is a silence into which the world cannot intrude. There is an ancient peace you carry in your heart and have not lost.I invite you to step aside, let go and share a quiet time of listening and being, amongst the trees and the natural environment.I hold a space for you, inviting you to immerse yourself in our natural environment, guiding you intuitively.

Our aim is to give local transport, climate and countryside and nature campaigners an opportunity to share ideas and inspiration. We want to celebrate our successes and work out what we need to focus on over the next 12 months or so before a General Election and in the face of some extraordinary backlashes to taking action on health and climate grounds.A﻿lso, this year marks some notable anniversaries, it being the 30th anniversary of the first ever national anti-roads conference and major protests at Twyford Down, while it is the 60th anniversary of the infamous Beeching report. To mark the occasion Emma Must, a prominent campaigner from the 1990s and ALARM UK days has agreed to read some of her poetry about the anti-roads movement.W﻿e've got some great speakers and contributors:Jonathan Bray - ex-director, Urban Transport GroupRoxanne de Beaux - Executive Director, Camcycle (part of Cambridge Sustainable Travel Alliance)Isabelle Clement MBE - CEO, Wheels for WellbeingC﻿laire Haigh - founder & CEO of Greener VisionRoger Harrabin - former BBC environment correspondentLisa Hopkinson - associate of Transport for Quality of LifeProfessor Glenn Lyons - Professor of Future Mobility, UWE BristolDavid Milner - Deputy Director, Create StreetsStefan Rollnick - Head of The Misinformation Cell, Lynn GlobalWe've gone for London to make it easier for those from the East and South East who  found it difficult getting to Birmingham last year. The venue is close to Kings Cross and Euston so is still easy to get to from the North and the Midlands. We aim to put the spotlight on the existential threat to public transport and active travel as the Government cuts funding in order to allow it to build more roads. This is while the potholes on local roads get ever bigger. At the same time The Government has ordered Network Rail not to replace worn out infrastructure, creating a short term saving but costing more in the long term. The Government's obsession with making things worse is seen by its determined inaction on cutting carbon quickly enough as it now admits it won't meet its international target to cut emissions by 68% by 2030.W﻿e also want to run some sessions to give campaigners the understanding and skills to deal with some of the disingenuous and toxic messaging that is being used against cutting traffic.T﻿AN 2022 conference in BirminghamWe will have two sets of workshops, covering a variety of topics as follows, so there should be something for everyone: Lessons from Welsh Roads Review &  road policy changes in EnglandWhere to next for buses?The future of railActive travel - achieving the 2030 targetAir pollution: What next for Clean Air Zones and more?Nature / biodiversity / roadkillHow can we get planning to step off the road to nowhere?Campaign messaging - mythbusting and reclaiming the narrativeMedia training - how to write a press release, appear on radio / TV The event will provide the perfect opportunity for networking and meeting people you mostly only ever see on a screen. We hope it will cement friendships and empower the large number of people who have been campaigning at a grassroots level over the past few years.If you would like to reclaim your entrance ticket and rail fare we do have a small amount to pay for bursaries.

Into The Woods - Ellie Davies,"July 27, 2023, 10:00 AM","July 27, 2023, 06:00 PM","178 Brompton Road, London, SW3 1HQ, United Kingdom","In Ellie Davies' body of work, the forest, this impressive natural environment, is her studio. Davies grew up in the New Forest, and spent her childhood exploring and playing in the woods with her sister. Now, as an artist, she uses photography to examine her relationship with that natural environment, and try to reconnect with the wild landscapes of her youth. Ultimately, can those remembered and imagined places be recaptured?In her new series, ""Chalk Streams"", Davies showcases the importance of one of the world's rarest ecosystems: the chalk stream. Under threat from manmade and environmental stressors, the chalk stream provides a setting for a high biodiversity of plants and creatures, and rival rainforests and coral reefs in their ecological importance. As 85% of chalk streams are found across the UK, it was a natural progression for Davies' body of work. The forest, as a symbol in folklore and human psychology, is richly tapestried within human experience and literature. It is against, and within, this verdant background that Davies explore the natural landscape, and creates a sort of limbo zone between reality and fantasy. The temporary interventions she creates in the forest demonstrate her profound respect and love for this immense biosphere.T﻿he show will coincide with the publication of Ellie Davies' monograph.

"Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) for FinTech SMEs","July 26, 2023, 06:00 PM","July 26, 2023, 07:30 PM","39 Bartholomew Close, London, EC1A 7JN, United Kingdom","Environmental, Social and Governance for FinTech SMEs
– A unified ESG Scoring and measurement framework for stakeholder capitalism that FinTech can comply with, measure and be regulated to delivery capacity.
Background
FinTech SMEs find it challenging to identify methods that best suit them to bridge the gap between unsustainable and sustainable practices. Various ESG frameworks target various industry sectors, but SMEs find it challenging to identify a framework method that best suits them, as they seek to comply with emerging United Kingdom regulations. Led by the WCIT Financial Services Technology Panel, a group of industry experts on ESG, Risk and Sustainability, and post-graduate MSc students of the City, University of London conducted a comparative study of various ESG frameworks, coming up with suggestions for a unified ESG scoring and measuring framework for stakeholder capitalism that can be measured and regulated to deliver capability for FinTech SMEs. The Speakers will present the findings from the study and the recommendations of practical frameworks that assist in the development of business capability in meeting ESG targets and how using the Social Value Capability Improvement Model developed by the WCIT can assist in terms of the recommended frameworks and in terms of its ability to deliver guidance on evaluating an organisation's progress against its own ESG agenda.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive [CSRD] has to be incorporated into member state law by 2024, and with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards [ESRS] being adopted in June this year, businesses are scrambling. They need to prepare existing systems and processes or overhaul them completely to produce consistent, comparable, and quality data that is compliant with the regulation. And they need to do this at speed. A lack of clarity as to how the upcoming regulation will impact businesses and what they will be legally obliged to disclose, combined with differing global collection standards and capabilities has meant many are already behind in their preparation for the CSRD. The pressure is building as the risk of not being CSRD compliant increases. On top of this, business must match stakeholder requirements to provide material information that stands up to scrutiny and presented in a coherent, engaging format.At Sustainability Reporting Europe 2023, a part of IMPACT Congress London, we will help you understand how  to utilise systems and processes to provide consistent, comparable, and reliable data in an automated fashion, explore how sustainability can work closer and more effectively together with finance, risk, and legal teams, and how businesses can meet regulatory requirements while not losing sight of the ‘why’ we report.F﻿or more event information, visit the official website here: https://events.reutersevents.com/sustainable-business/reporting-europe?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_campaign=5912",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/reuters-events-65905943663,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reuters-events-sustainability-reporting-europe-2023-tickets-636464230647,London

Old Oak West is one of the largest regenerations schemes in the country, redeveloping industrial and railways land around the new High Speed 2 station at Old Oak Common. The Strategic Development and Infrastructure Team (SD&I) at Homes England have been working closely with the Old Oak and Park Royal Development Corporation, OPDC to prepare the five case Green Book business case for Old Oak West; acting as the lead client coordinating inputs from an array of supporting consultants and brokering relations between different public sector partners. 
The SD&I team have also, for the past three years run a mentoring programme with Oxford Brookes University Architecture School. This year we asked the students to come up with an intervention at Old Oak West that addresses one of OPDC’s golden threads while also contributing to site-wide sustainability and social value.
The students have been given free rein to interpret the brief and have come up with a variety of interventions that respond to the site and their take on addressing sustainability.
The students will be presenting their work to Homes England and OPDC on Monday 31st July in Windsor House, so come along and see what they have been up to. The session will be presented on Teams for anybody who would like to dial in.
Please use the link below to register your interest.

The OPDC golden threads are:
A local life: A place that grew for London’s workers, now set to meet the challenge of the housing crisis and workplace evolution.
Jobs for the future: A place renowned for ingenuity in manufacture and food, now primed for future big-bang industries to solve the world’s big challenges.
The middle of everywhere: A place shaped by historic innovations in infrastructure, now in a pivotal location to connect to the world, nation, city and neighbours.
A green space that keeps growing: A place where nature has quietly flourished now being opened up to enjoy. We’re setting ambitious goals for a healthy, sustainable future.

The dizzying combination of plastic, leather, rubber, foam, metal and adhesives means that sneakers can take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade. About 90% of these shoes end up in landfill.One way to prevent this is to recycle them. There are several ways of doing this, and customisation could be one of them, creating a chance to stem the tide of waste. Raising awareness about this and giving shoes a second chance in the fashion system could potentially have an important impact on our planet. So what can you do? Everyone has at least one pair of shoes that sits unloved in the back of the closet. Led by footwear designer Hernan Guardamagna, learn how to rekindle the love you once had for them, restoring them to practical items that give you renewed pleasure and a useful purpose. This family friendly event is likely to appeal to anyone with an interest in shoes, recycling, sustainability, the environment and fashion. Bring any shoes that you would like to customise. Give them a good cleaning before the workshop so they are ready to work with when you arrive. All materials will be provided but if you have any accessories or decorative materials that you would like to use, please bring them along. There will be some shoe-related activities for the little ones, also for anyone who  attends the workshop but without any shoes to customise.T﻿his event will be hosted by Art in the Docks, a 5 minute walk from Gallions Reach DLR station.

Net Zero Nations Projects Conference,"November 15, 2023, 08:30 AM","November 15, 2023, 04:00 PM","1 Great George Street Westminster, London, SW1P 3AA, United Kingdom","We are at a crossroads in our historyAs we recover from the impact of the pandemic on our lives and livelihoods, we know that it will not be enough to go back to the way things were before.The science is clear, we know that human activity is changing our climate and that this will have a devastating impact on human lives, the economy, and the natural world – ranging from the extinction of some species and the melting of ice caps to extreme weather patterns threatening our homes, businesses, and communities. Energy security and net zero are two sides of the same coin. The energy transition and net zero are among the greatest opportunities facing this country and we are committed to ensuring that the UK takes advantage of its early mover status. Global action to mitigate climate change is essential to long term prosperity – the overall costs and risks of global warming to be equivalent to losing between 5% and 20% of global GDP each year.After decades of reliance on imported fossil fuels, the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s mission is to replace them with cheaper, cleaner, domestic sources of energy. In response to high household energy bills resulting from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the government stepped in, paying around half of the average household’s energy bills over winter and around half of wholesale energy costs for some businesses. But the way to maintain lower cost energy for everyone is to move to cleaner and cheaper energy to protect us from volatile international energy markets, while underpinning our clean energy transition, so the UK becomes a net zero economy by 2050. It will also help us make sure Britain has among the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe by 2035. The UK has already made huge progress in decarbonising its economy and decoupling emissions from economic growth. Thanks to the Climate Change Act (2008) and Environment Act (2021), we have a strong legal framework for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Between 1990 and 2021, we have cut our emissions by 48%, decarbonising faster than any other G7 country, whilst growing the economy by 65%. The UK was also the first G7 country to sign net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 into law. The UK’s strategy for net-zero is to lead the world in ending our contribution to climate change while turning this mission into the greatest opportunity for jobs and prosperity for our country since the industrial revolution.Removing dirty fossil fuels from the global economy will lead to the creation of vast new global industries from offshore wind to electric vehicles and carbon capture and storage. By moving first and making the United Kingdom the birthplace of the Green Industrial Revolution we are building a defining competitive edge. The changes will have wider benefits for the public and businesses alike. We will all enjoy cleaner air, increased biodiversity and improved access to green spaces. We will see greater efficiency in the way we travel and heat our buildings, which will be better protected from more extreme weather events. We will also put consumers at the heart of this transition, helping them make their homes warmer, and more efficient, and ensure that they pay a fair, affordable price for their energy.In 2050, we will still be driving cars, flying planes and heating our homes, but our cars will be electric gliding silently around our cities, our planes will be zero-emission allowing us to fly guilt-free, and our homes will be heated by cheap reliable power drawn from the winds of the North Sea. And everywhere you look, in every part of our United Kingdom, there will be jobs. Good jobs, green jobs, well-paid jobs, levelling up our country while squashing down our carbon emissions. That is the clean and prosperous future that awaits every one of us as the UK leads the world in the race to net zero. But we cannot tackle climate change alone. We will need to take a coordinated approach, working across local and national government, the devolved administrations, and with businesses and civil society organisations. And we will need to make it easier and fairer for individuals, businesses and households to decarbonise so that our whole society can work together to reduce emissions. Don’t miss this fantastic opportunity to attend the conference and hear from those leading on the net-zero agenda by highlighting key examples of case studies and projects from around the world using new innovations and technologies which can help accelerate the transition to a net-zero nation by 2050.Join us on the 15th of Novembner 2023 for the Net Zero Nations Projects Conference.Get Involved, We All Have A Part to Play…..Find Yours!",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/evolutional-events-44657800583,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/net-zero-nations-projects-conference-registration-670628737607,London

Oliver Franklin-Wallis: Wasteland: The Dirty Truth About What We Throw Away,"October 10, 2023, 06:30 PM","October 10, 2023, 07:30 PM","14-16 Friary Street, Guildford, GU1 4EH, United Kingdom","When we throw things ‘away’, what does that actually mean? Where does it go, and who deals with it when it gets there? In Wasteland, award-winning journalist Oliver Franklin-Wallis takes us on an eye-opening journey through the global waste industry. From the mountainous landfills of New Delhi to Britain’s overflowing sewers, from hollowed-out mining towns in the USA to Ghana’s flooded second-hand markets, we meet the people on the frontline of our waste crisis – both those being exploited, and those determined to make a difference. On the way, we discover the corporate greenwashing that started the recycling movement; the dark truth behind our second-hand donations; and come face to face with the 10,000-year legacy of our nuclear waste. Both shocking and hopeful, Wasteland is the timely and ultimately human story at the heart of an urgent global issue.ABOUT THE AUTHOROliver Franklin-Wallis is an award-winning magazine journalist, whose writing has appeared in GQ, WIRED, The Guardian, the New York Times, The Times Magazine, The Sunday Times Magazine, The Economist's 1843 magazine, and many other publications.

Want to dive deeper into building a vision for transformative climate reparations? Want to see that collective vision turned into a piece of artwork for an upcoming exhibition on the topic? Join us for a workshop in London on Saturday 26th August. This interactive workshop will reflect on  the history of the colonial debt crisis, what it means for our wider movements, and how we can work together to support each other’s campaigns. We will explore the concept of climate reparations and how debt justice can be part of a broader agenda to repair the harm faced by communities around the world. As part of the workshop, we’ll be co-creating an artistic response to the topic to be displayed at an exhibition on debt, colonialism, and the climate crisis at Peckham Levels in November 2023. If you don’t consider yourself an artist, don’t worry - we still want you to come along and input into our shared vision for change. Right now, 54 countries are in debt crisis, with the need to make repayments stopping them from investing in healthcare, education, and responding to the climate crisis. This is not an accident. For centuries, powerful governments, institutions and corporations have used debt to control and plunder the resources of countries in the global south for their own gain. At the same time, countries and communities in the global south are disproportionately facing the impacts of the climate crisis.From colonial powers forcing countries into debt at the point of independence, to allowing corporations like BlackRock to continue to make huge profits from debt repayments today, we can’t build new visions of reparative justice without understanding the roots of the crisis we face.When: Saturday 26th August 2023, 2pm-5pm.Where: Dance Hall, Waterloo Action Centre, SE1 7AAAccess information: Wheelchair access, accessible toilets.

From Overwhelm to Activism: In Conversation,"July 23, 2023, 02:45 PM","July 23, 2023, 03:30 PM","186 Tooley Street, London, SE1 2TZ, United Kingdom","As of March 2023, 64% of adults in Great Britain were ‘somewhat’ or ‘very worried’ about the impact of climate change. This phenomenon, aptly named eco-anxiety, represents an extreme concern about the present and future harm caused by human activity and climate change. 


It is a fear felt most strongly by younger generations, and one in three young people in Britain are scared, sad or pessimistic about climate change, with 28% feeling ‘overwhelmed’. But let's pause for a moment and reflect. Feelings of fear and worry often act as a powerful alarm, alerting us to imminent danger and prompting us to take action. 


Could it be that eco-anxiety is the fuel we need to propel ourselves into meaningful climate action? Join Zoe Rasbash and James Barlow in conversation as they explore how climate anxiety can be embraced to become a powerful catalyst for climate action.

Climate Café,"July 27, 2023, 02:00 PM","July 27, 2023, 03:30 PM","Market Place, Abingdon, OX14 3HG, United Kingdom","

Please join us for the well regarded warm and friendly climate cafes which provide a supportive space in which to talk about how the climate crisis is affecting us – without pressure to act.This session will be facilitated by Michelle and Rebecca from Low Carbon Oxford North. Climate cafés are not drop-in events, and numbers are limited to 12, so please try to arrive in time for the start (though we won’t turn you away if you’re a few minutes late and there are still spaces!).

Climate Cafés offer something different from the usual gatherings of people with interests in climate change. They are facilitated – so you can be sure that there will be space for you to speak. They are not designed to recruit you to do anything or to put you under any pressure. The idea behind them is that talking about climate change is really important – but it is often made more difficult by our feelings of guilt that we are not doing enough, or frustration that others are not doing enough. So a space is provided in which we don’t talk about what we or others are doing or should be doing. We just talk about climate change and how it is making us think and feel.

Everyone is welcome, though we don’t advise young children attending. (18 years plus) There’s no charge.

Speakers will explain the case and its wider implications for climate change. La Colosa, AngloGold Ashanti proposes to exploit and open-pit gold mine in the beautiful agricultural and highly sensitive ecological area important for climate change, of the Nevados paramos  and a Central Forestal Reserve in Colombia.  Hear about the communities’ struggle as they effectively use legal mechanisms only to continue seeing their rights denied.
Whilst international trade rules and institutions set out to hold governments accountable and ensure that changes in national laws do not unduly inhibit international commerce, a trading system has been established that unduly inhibits the ability of governments to protect health, safety, and the environment. This event will discuss the case of La Colosa Mine owned by multinational AngloGold Ashanti, the dangers due to international trading and investment agreements that can hinder peace and the fulfilment of Colombia’s climate change commitments. As well as, why the UK needs a Business, human rights and environment law, and what it should look like.

London is an Urban Forest,"July 23, 2023, 01:45 PM","July 23, 2023, 02:30 PM","186 Tooley Street, London, SE1 2TZ, United Kingdom","According to the UK’s Forestry Commission, London is the world’s largest urban forest. There's nearly as many trees in the city as there are people – 8.4 million to be exact. In the midst of towering structures and concrete streets, these trees play a crucial role in purifying the air we breathe, diligently absorbing pollutants and mitigating the impacts of climate change. In a city grappling with toxic levels of pollution, their presence is invaluable. Yet, the significance of London’s trees is often overlooked. Often hidden in plain sight, Despite their immense importance, these unsung heroes often go unnoticed, overshadowed or hidden in plain sight. Join us as we shine a light on London's urban forest, paying homage to the green guardians of the city.H﻿ost: Divya Hariramani / Sustainable Design Consultant and Founder of Fruity Walks“My name is Divya, and I run an Instagram page called FRUITY WALKS, where I find, map and plant fruit trees in the city of London. I like to think of myself as a modern-day urban fruit tree forager. Did you know there are fruiting Lemon, Pomegranate and Avocado trees in Zones 1 and 2 in London?! Pretty wild, right?!The initial concept behind Fruity Walks was the novelty of finding these more unexpected species within the city centre, a page on Instagram to inspire people to pay more attention to their surroundings while going from point A to B during their day-to-day. That has now evolved slightly into more of an emphasis on understanding the stories behind these trees, how they arrived here and the people that planted them. Sharing stories of immigration and how planting seeds in their new far away homes kept them connected to their roots. I’m also a London National Park City Ranger in Southwark/Tower Hamlets and am passionate about creating more spaces for community orchards and making existing orchards more welcoming and accessible, so I share many of the initiatives I'm taking part in through Fruity Walks too.I balance those hobbies with my full-time job as a sustainable design engineer in the built environment.”Susannah Littlewood / Senior Partnerships & Development Coordinator, Trees for CitiesAs Senior Partnerships and Development Coordinator at Trees for Cities, Susannah works with partners across Greater London to set up tree planting projects in the places they're needed most. She has spent time studying how interventions at the regional, city, and local-scale can help us to tackle the climate and nature emergencies and loves hearing about and being inspired by initiatives taking place in London and beyond!Hosted by Divya Hariramani and Susannah Littlewood as part of In a Field by a Bridge festival - inafieldbyabridge.com",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/in-a-field-by-a-bridge-68076542233,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/london-is-an-urban-forest-tickets-675464341027,London

The Climate Cafe - Worthing,"July 26, 2023, 07:00 PM","July 26, 2023, 08:30 PM","South Street, Worthing, BN11 3AL, United Kingdom","As it becomes more evident that climate and ecological breakdown are a clear and present danger to our safety and wellbeing, we increasingly need to talk about what our changing world means for us in terms of impacts at personal, family and societal level. We need to imagine it in some detail so as to be able to think about it clearly and constructively, and to explore some complex feelings and thoughts which may often be taboo and hard to talk about.With sturdy enough support structures in place, most people can sustain challenging feelings without either dissociating and numbing or going into blind panic. They can engage with difficult truths whilst staying connected and grounded.A climate café aims to be such a structure - a container that is strong enough to allow the exploration of fear, anxiety, and other emotions such as anger, helplessness, sadness, grief or depression.The focus of discussion is participants’ thoughts and feelings about the climate and ecological crisis. There are no guest speakers and no talks, and it is an advice-free zone.
