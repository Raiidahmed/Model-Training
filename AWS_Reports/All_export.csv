With a rapid expansion predicted for Web3 platforms and energy-intensive technologies like AI, the province’s mining sector could play a strong role in developing the data centre infrastructure that will help Quebec stay competitive in the new digital economy. Mining is about so much more than just Bitcoin – join the Canadian Blockchain Consortium’s Montreal event to discover the opportunities created by the mining industry and what it could mean to Quebec’s digital future.  Panel Topic: Mining Data Centres as an Economic DriverSynopsis: Successful Bitcoin mining hubs have discovered that the benefits of the industry extend beyond the establishment of profitable companies. In regions like Texas, mining firms have rejuvenated post-industrial towns, created high-value jobs and educational programs, and supported the development of important infrastructure and civic services, ranging from roads to community centres. Join this expert panel to learn why miners have a vested interest in long-term relationships, and how the ecosystems of blockchain companies that form around them can help transform municipalities into innovation hubs. Panel Topic: Leveraging Bitcoin Mining ConvergenceSynopsis: The true power of Bitcoin mining is in its convergence with key industries. In Quebec, mining data centres can play an important role in making renewables more profitable, increasing the sustainability of agriculture, and supporting the growth of disruptive digital companies that will benefit the province’s global competitiveness. In other parts of the world, mining has been an accelerant for green infrastructure development and a valuable revenue source for electricity grids due to its flexibility as a power consumer.

The Sacramento region and Provence share a rich agricultural bounty owing to our Mediterranean climates. All that is needed for a feast—olives and olive oil, vegetables, nuts, wines, lamb, and more—is cultivated from the soil of our region.In the spirit of a Grand Aïoli, please bring your own table settings, plates (salad, entrée , and dessert plate), silverware, water glasses, and napkins so you can enjoy this communal meal. The menuAperitifs include olives, nuts, and local  rosé wines. The meal is served family-style, with accompanying local wines placed on the tables, starting with passed platters of heirloom tomatoes drizzled with local olive oil and freshly made baguettes. Steamed and grilled local vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, and bowls of garlic-scented aïoli  follow the tomatoes. Next comes the grilled lamb and summer white bean salad. The bottles empty, the bread is eaten, and dessert is served—fruit tart, or as the French say, a galette.

How do we navigate this new age of extremes? In A Traveler's Guide to the End of the World, David Gessner takes readers on an eye-opening tour of climate hotspots from the Gulf of Mexico to the burning American West to New York City to the fragile Outer Banks, where homes are being swallowed by the seas. He does so with his usual sense of humor, compassion, and a willingness to talk to anyone, providing an informative and sobering yet convivial guide for the age of fire, heat, wind, and water.Gessner approaches scientists and thinkers with a father's question: What will the world be like in forty-two years? Gessner was forty-two when his daughter, Hadley, was born. What will the world be like in 2064, when Hadley is his age now? What is the future of weather? The future of heat, storms, and fire? What exactly will our children be facing? A Traveler's Guide to the End of the World tells a story of climate crisis that will both entertain and shake people awake to the necessity of navigating this new age together.David Gessner is the author of Quiet Desperation, Savage Delight: Sheltering with Thoreau in the Age of Crisis, Leave It As It Is: A Journey Through Theodore Roosevelt’s American Wilderness, and the New York Times–bestselling All the Wild That Remains: Edward Abbey, Wallace Stegner and the American West. Chair of the Creative Writing Department at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and founder and editor-in-chief of Ecotone, Gessner lives in Wilmington, North Carolina, with his wife, the novelist Nina de Gramont, and their daughter, Hadley.Nina de Gramont’s latest novel, The Christie Affair, is an international and New York Times bestseller, and the Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick for February, 2022. The Christie Affair has been translated into more than twenty languages. Nina is also the author of a collection of short stories, as well as the novels Gossip of the Starlings and The Last September.

But following the public assassination of a dozen climate criminals, Emi’s mother, Kristina, disappears as a possible suspect, and Emi’s illusions of utopia are shattered. A determined Emi and her father, Larch, journey from their home in Nuuk, Greenland to New York City, now a lightly populated storm-surge outpost built from the ruins of the former metropolis. But they aren’t the only ones looking for Kristina.Thirty years earlier, Larch first came to New York with a team of volunteers to save the city from rising waters and torrential storms. Kristina was on the frontlines of a different battle, fighting massive wildfires that ravaged the western United States. They became part of a movement that changed the world­—The Great Transition—forging a new society and finding each other in process.Alternating between Emi’s desperate search for her mother and a meticulously rendered, heart-stopping account of her parents’ experiences during The Great Transition, this novel beautifully shows how our actions today determine our fate tomorrow. A triumphant debut, The Great Transition is a breathtaking rendering of our near future, told through the story of one family trying to protect each other and the place we all call home.Nick Fuller Googins has published short stories and essays in The Paris Review, the Los Angeles Times, The Southern Review, and elsewhere. He lives in Maine, and works as an elementary school teacher. The Great Transition is his first novel.Moderator Miriam Wasser is a senior reporter with WBUR's climate and environment team.

About the Alnoba Peace Foundation
A world in need of healing
From climate change to the impact of technology on our minds and the economy, our world is in crisis. A winner-take-all society isolates us from each other and from the earth that sustains us. Our communities are broken, consumption and waste run rampant, and we are severed from the healing power of the natural world.
Both we and the world need a change. Start that change on the inside. You can overcome the harmful and destructive patterns imposed on you by this broken world we’re living in, opening to a more natural and authentic way of engaging with yourself and our planet.
The power to change
There are both ancient and pioneering tools you can use to rewrite your patterns, breaking free of the old way of thinking and being as you tap into something stronger: a way of living that connects us harmoniously to both each other and the earth we share.
Manny Muros has spent decades studying, practicing and sharing the spiritual techniques that lead to greater self-awareness and self-realization. His wisdom teachings are insights gained through a lifetime of deep practice and exploration. Through meditation and affirmative practices, he teaches students how to center, deconstruct old patterns and recover a truer way of being.
The sacred land of Alnoba, with its pristine fields and forests and inspiring collection of outdoor art, serves as a potent space for undertaking this journey of transformation.
Be the difference
To use the ancient words of wisdom: as it is above, so it is below. The world we cultivate inside ourselves makes a real impact on the one that surrounds us. By changing one, we impact the other.
Step forward into your own change, breaking free of a paradigm that destroys both our well-being and that of our planet. Discover a healthier, more authentic alternative that empowers you to be the change you seek.

Valley Growing Gardens is a family-grown urban Food Scaped Oasis in the  middle of beautiful downtown Puyallup. Years ago, the Cowan family decided that self-sufficiency and the ability to grow their own food was paramount to a truly healthy way of life. They began to learn everything they could about the principles of Permaculture and endeavored to build their Food Forest/Urban Farm. As a family, they designed these gardens as a study in efficiency and sustainability, limited only by the size of their city lot. Every year, the family rethinks their gardens and dreams up ways to incorporate and grow additional varieties with greater volumes of food plants. Valley Growing Gardens is all Organic and has not sprayed or been treated for any pests or diseases since its inception. They continue to work with Nature to encourage a wholesome balance in Harmony with the earth. The family wants to encourage people to listen to Nature and build gardens for the future in an Earth-Friendly and Sustainable way. We develop and produce our own compost. We will be teaching and helping others to garden/farm regeneratively by bringing life back into our soils. Without good healthy soil, there will be no food! Mother Earth is sending out an S.O.S and we want to help. We can help you learn how to garden regeneratively and how to help to sequester more carbon into the soil. Life is soil and soil is Life. The most important take-away from this humble valley garden is that no matter whether you live on acres of land or in a small apartment, you can grow good, Organic Food. In this class you will tour the gardens and be thought the principles of growing organically while working with nature.

Whether you are an experienced teacher, or new to the teaching profession you will feel excited and motivated for your upcoming school year after participating in this highly immersive and collaborative workshop. Participants will engage in thought-provoking, pertinent experiments, and activities that you can utilize in your own classroom. We will spend time observing instruction from the point of view of a student (“student-mode”), and learn strategies to incorporate in their own classroom using the claim, evidence, reasoning (CER) framework, Social Ecological Systems (SES), transdisciplinary thinking, and panarchy as tools to probe student preconceptions. Periodically, participants will switch to “teacher-mode”, to practice Socratic questioning techniques, analyze readings, and discuss the pedagogical rationale for all aspects of active learning and modeling in Environmental Science. We’ll also discuss strategies for accommodating district-specific curricular requirements, various student populations, laboratory resources, and the use of “Reflective Checklists” as a way of promoting student reflection throughout a unit.The Applied Panarchy in Environmental Science curriculum curriculum blends a humanities-based lens with scientific methods to create a transdisciplinary approach, to empower students to live more sustainable lives. Panarchy transcends the boundaries of scale and discipline. Most importantly, the panarchy model advocates a transition from a static understanding of nature to a dynamic idea that places an emphasis on multiple stable states, resilience, and cross-scale interactions that result in adaptive change. The adaptive cycle –  in its development, deployment, and representation – ties each of the units of the APES curriculum together.

The Balance of Energy between all thingsLocated on a historic farm estate, Orenda winery blends rustic-charm with classic-elegance. Orenda is the perfect location for your event.Orenda Winery brought together three friends with a shared commitment—to build community and to bring Orenda to winemaking. We believe wine should maintain a balance between bold and subtle flavors. To execute this vision, we have partnered with some of the highest elevation vineyards in Washington state in both Yakima Valley and Columbia Valley. High elevation provides a cool climate with late ripening fruit. This allows the grapes more time to mature, making wine less bold and significantly more subtle than wines from warmer regions. When aged in small French oak barrels, the results are complex, dynamic flavors reminiscent of an old-world style rarely found in Washington wines.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/della-terra-14728494784,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/farm-to-table-winemakers-dinner-featuring-della-terra-orenda-winery-tickets-633333907767,Seattle

In addition to our personal losses, given the emergent climate crisis and its impacts – the extinction of species, the COVID pandemic, and the unrest and turmoil within human societies – the burden of grief that we are carrying as individuals can begin to feel unbearable. There are very few spaces where we are invited to experience and express this complex grief in community. This retreat will utilize Francis Weller’s “Five Gates of Grief” to connect participants to their distinct and multifaceted experiences of grief in the context of a ""sudden village."". The weekend will be facilitated by experienced grief mentors who have apprenticed in the grief ritual tradition of the Dagara tribe as brought to the U.S. and shared by Malidoma and Sobonfu Somé. We have been oriented to this tradition through mentorship with Francis Weller and others. Participants will be guided through chanting, poetry, teaching, writing exercises, small group sharing, and the creation of a grief shrine. Our time together will culminate in a communal grief ritual. All participation is invitational; nothing is ""required"" beyond being present with and sharing the griefs you are carrying, to the best of your ability.Fee: $400 - Early Bird Registration by August  15; $450 after August 15. If the fee presents a barrier to your participation, please let us know.R﻿ecent significant loss: If you have experienced a significant or traumatic loss within the last three months, please reach out to speak with a facilitator before registering.Registration Deadline: Thursday, September 28.

There are approximately 164 glaciers left, and many will cease to exist in our lifetime. While we may not be able to spare glacial ice from the ravages of climate change, we can preserve what the Olympic glaciers mean to us. The Terminus Glacier Memorial project, supported by donors of Washington’s National Park Fund, launched in 2022 with the creation of an Artist in Residence program at Olympic National Park.T﻿he project coordinated a group of 40 talented volunteer artists and assigned each person to memorialize one of the park's glaciers through a diverse array of media including poetry, painting, fiber arts, film, embroidery, animation, stained glass, and more. The goal is to provide a visual timeline of each glacier's life and story and draw attention to the impacts of climate change on the park's ecosystems.To learn more, visit: Terminus Glacier Memorial project, where you can see the Terminus Art that has already been created with new works of art added weekly.

Williams, a naturalist, author, and educator, to discuss his book Homewaters. His many books include the award-winning Too High and Too Steep: Reshaping Seattle's Topography and Seattle Walks: Discovering History and Nature in the City.  David B. Williams will be interviewed by bestselling author Erica Bauermeister, directly after they return to land from the Schooner Zodiac Books a'Sail Cruise, 2023! Click here for more information on a book group at sea!Doors open and music begins at 6:30pm!Musical Guest: Ben BauermeisterSpaces are limited and REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED to secure your spot so don't delay. About the bookNot far from Seattle skyscrapers live 150-year-old clams, more than 250 species of fish, and underwater kelp forests as complex as any terrestrial ecosystem. For millennia, vibrant Coast Salish communities have lived beside these waters dense with nutrient-rich foods, with cultures intertwined through exchanges across the waterways. Transformed by settlement and resource extraction, Puget Sound and its future health now depend on a better understanding of the region's ecological complexities.Focusing on the area south of Port Townsend and between the Cascade and Olympic mountains, Williams uncovers human and natural histories in, on, and around the Sound. In conversations with archaeologists, biologists, and tribal authorities, Williams traces how generations of humans have interacted with such species as geoducks, salmon, orcas, rockfish, and herring. He sheds light on how warfare shaped development and how people have moved across this maritime highway, in canoes, the mosquito fleet, and today's ferry system. The book also takes an unflinching look at how the Sound's ecosystems have suffered from human behavior, including pollution, habitat destruction, and the effects of climate change.Witty, graceful, and deeply informed, Homewaters weaves history and science into a fascinating and hopeful narrative, one that will introduce newcomers to the astonishing life that inhabits the Sound and offers longtime residents new insight into and appreciation of the waters they call home.""Homewaters is a sweeping exploration of how a place shapes lives. It begins with glaciers and volcanoes carving up Puget Sound, and examines early Native communities’ relationships with their environment, colonial exploitation of natural resources and efforts to better understand how keystone and emblematic species like salmon, orca, rockfish, herring, kelp and more are enduring the conditions of the Sound today."" -- CrosscutAbout the presentersDavid B. Williams is a writer, historian, and tour guide focused on the intersection between people and landscape, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.Erica Bauermeister is the author of the bestselling novel The School of Essential Ingredients, Joy for Beginners, and The Lost Art of Mixing.

Cost: $30 for the full three-part series, and receive a $10 gift card at each workshop. Sponsored by the San Francisco Public Utilities CommissionThe Introduction to Sustainable Gardening series is a three-part workshop series designed to help you transform your yard into a thriving, sustainable garden. This course will teach you everything you need to know to nurture perennial gardens that conserve water, provide beauty, and attract pollinators and beneficial insects.San Francisco is a beautiful and unique city, with year-round mild temperatures and dry, foggy summers. Learn what plants are adapted to our coastal climate and grow without the need for toxic pesticides or large amounts of water. This course will focus on native and drought-tolerant ornamental gardens but will cover broad topics that can also apply to vegetable gardening.The full series is $30, but you will get $10 gift cards to the Urban Farmer Store at each workshop (for a total of $30 in gift cards if you attend the two workshops).Registering will sign you up for the full series of three workshops. Please only register if you plan to attend all three sessions. SERIES SUMMARY: Part I: Sustainable Garden Design  This workshop will teach you how to design a beautiful, functional, and thriving home garden space. San Francisco urban gardens come with all sorts of unique challenges (fog, wind, steep hillsides, sandy soil) and it can be difficult to know where to start. Instructor Ellyn will provide information to help you evaluate and design garden spaces and choose plants to match the space, a principle called ""Right Plant, Right Place"". Part II: Water-Wise Gardening This workshop will take a more detailed look at the many beautiful plants that grow well in San Francisco and how you can care for them without using lots of water. Even with San Francisco’s dry and foggy summers, there is an amazing palate of climate-appropriate plants that will thrive here with little or no summer water so that you can conserve water and save on your bill. Instructor Ellyn will teach you about all of this and also about how to water your plants properly and group them by similar water needs to help them reach their full potential. Part III: Organic Pest Control Learn how a healthy and biodiverse garden can thrive without the use of pesticides. Ellyn will discuss the notion that most plant health problems are caused by poor growing conditions or improper planting, and that pests and diseases may be secondary problems. Plant health care involves a combination of strategies including monitoring, and you'll learn strategies to attract beneficial insects, and keep pests, diseases, and weeds at bay naturally. Instructor Ellyn Shea is a Bay Area gardener, garden coach, Certified Arborist, consultant, and educator. She is a longtime Garden for the Environment teacher and supporter and shares her extensive gardening knowledge in this workshop series.

I can’t stop thinking about this visionary novel and its singular characters. Nick Fuller Googins has written a book for the present and the future — read this and you will be changed.” — Michelle Min Sterling, New York Times bestselling author of Camp Zero“A magnificent debut novel that’s both an important cautionary tale and a deeply compelling family story. Although set in a stunningly well-imagined future in the aftermath of a climate apocalypse, The Great Transition is electrifyingly relevant.” — William Kent Krueger, New York Times bestselling author of This Tender Land“[The Great Transition] melds the huge and the intimate, the imperatives of our global climate crisis with the more compact narrative of a family trying to do right by one another when the world goes sideways. Fuller-Googins stares down some of today's biggest societal issues with abundant imagination and endless empathy.” — Emily Nemens, author of The Cactus League“Nick Fuller Googins demonstrates exactly the kind of clear-eyed utopian thinking we’ll need more of as we work together to solve our climate crisis, wrapping a call to action, accountability, and mutual aid in a story that’s as thrilling as it is moving. Every worthwhile novel sets out to change its reader—this one sets out to change the world. I hope it does.” — Matt Bell, author of Appleseed“The Great Transition asks what it means to start over — as a society and as individuals — and then answers with visionary scope.

A determined Emi and her father, Larch, journey from their home in Nuuk, Greenland to New York City, now a lightly populated storm-surge outpost built from the ruins of the former metropolis. But they aren’t the only ones looking for Kristina.Thirty years earlier, Larch first came to New York with a team of volunteers to save the city from rising waters and torrential storms. Kristina was on the frontlines of a different battle, fighting massive wildfires that ravaged the western United States. They became part of a movement that changed the world­—The Great Transition—forging a new society and finding each other in process.Alternating between Emi’s desperate search for her mother and a meticulously rendered, heart-stopping account of her parents’ experiences during The Great Transition, this novel beautifully shows how our actions today determine our fate tomorrow.

They are believed to be devoid of intelligence and sentience. But new discoveries highlight that fishes are more complex than originally thought; they can feel pain and pleasure, have good memories, hunt cooperatively and can solve tasks. Equipped with this new knowledge we must ask ourselves: is it time to change the way we think about, and treat, fishes? In this session, we will hear personal stories about the unique lives of fishes that will make you fall in love with them - from Siamese fighting fish, to cleaner wrasse and stingrays and sharks. We will examine the way we treat them and how we can right these wrongs. In this talk, Naomi shares about her research on sharks, stingrays and Siamese fighting fish - and what we can do to help these often under-appreciated lives. About the host: Naomi Clark-Shen studies sharks and rays caught by fisheries in Southeast Asia.

Generating over half of the state’s greenhouse gases, the transportation sector is a major part of state and local decarbonization goals. At the same time, the state’s transportation infrastructure is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially increased storm activity and sea level rise. This session shares how the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and BART have recently explored bold changes to their transportation infrastructure and regulation to confront both challenges. SFMTA’s Climate Roadmap tackles the city’s ambitious emission and mode share goals through a suite of transformative interventions that draw on international case studies. In addition, their Waterfront Resiliency Transportation Assessment addresses the substantial impact that sea level rise and potential defense strategies will have on the city’s eastern waterfront and ways to adapt the transportation network to such a reality. BART's Sustainability Action Plan outlines BART's strategy to reduce emissions, optimize energy use, and incorporate climate resilience into districtwide operations. BART also has a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to reduce or eliminate risks to the system from natural disasters, particularly those that would be exacerbated by climate change.The panel will include representatives from the projects discussing the innovative analytical approaches and implementation frameworks leveraged, with lessons that other jurisdictions can utilize for their own climate mitigation and adaptation. The session will include a moderated discussion and Q&A to engage with the audience.Program ParticipantsModerators: 	Taylor McAdam, Senior Transportation Planner, Fehr & Peers Panelists: 	 Tim Doherty, Policy and Long-Range Planning Team Lead - San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency  (SFMTA)Matt  Goyne, Principal - Fehr & Peers Michael Cox,  Principal Sustainability Analyst - San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)When:	Wednesday August 9th, 5:30 -7:30pmWhere:	Port of San Francisco, Pier 1 The Embarcadero, Bayside Room, San Francisco, CA, 94105Cost:		$60 WTS Members / $80 Non-Members / $10 Students or UnemployedFood:		Buffet style dinner & drinks will be providedRSVP:	Please RSVP by August 4 via Eventbrite Here﻿For questions, please email us at ProgramsWTSSanFrancisco@gmail.comEmpowering Women, Transforming Transportation.

8006,Mid-Century Modernism in Berkeley? Featuring Journalist Dave Weinstein,2023-08-02 19:00:00,2023-08-02 20:30:00,"2315 Durant Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704","What is the signature architecture of the Berkeley Hills? Chances are good that brown-shingled Arts and Crafts homes quickly come to mind. But modern houses built from the 1940s through the 1970s — and, indeed, still today — make a sizable contribution to some of the most beautiful and, arguably, most mysterious neighborhoods anywhere.
On Wednesday, August 2, at 7 p.m., architecture enthusiast and journalist Dave Weinstein will take us on a photo tour of some of these distinctive homes in Berkeley and beyond, discuss why modernism came late to the Bay Area, and explain why — and with whom — it proved so popular. We’ll also learn how this style, which looks so different from Arts and Crafts buildings, actually is deeply indebted to the Craftsman ethos.
Tickets for this program are $5 for club members and $10 for non-members. Please register early so we can be sure to accommodate everyone comfortably and safely. Masks are strongly encouraged.
For years, Dave has written about Bay Area architecture for the San Francisco Chronicle. His popular books include Signature Architects of the Bay Area, Berkeley Rocks, and It Came from Berkeley: How Berkeley Changed the World. For the past twenty years, his well-researched articles have appeared in CA-Modern magazine, which focuses on the mid-century modern tract homes that the famed developer Joseph Eichler built in the Bay Area, as well as on other topics related to modern design.
Dave also has worked to publicize and preserve the historic and natural landscapes of El Cerrito, where he lives. He is president of the El Cerrito Historical Society and El Cerrito Trail Trekkers. He was instrumental in saving and restoring the Cerrito Theater (now the Rialto Cinemas Cerrito) and in protecting the Madera Open Space by having it added to the city’s Hillside Natural Area.
Dave grew up on Long Island and studied art history at Columbia University and journalism at UC-Berkeley.

Our programming is designed to encourage deep connections between attendees and help answer hard questions about textile-derived ocean pollution (i.e. microfiber pollution), climate change, textile waste, green chemistry, ocean-thoughtful material alternatives, and more.  This year's Textile X Ocean Connector Sail will be 5 hours - allowing time for educational programming, connecting deeply, and putting up the sails to enjoy some sailing! Participants will have the option to assist with sailing, or we welcome you to sit and enjoy the view. The longer sail will allow us to spend more time outside of the Golden Gate Bridge and see more of the San Francisco Bay! Educational activities include demonstrations of marine research techniques and participation in ""Educational Tastings"" - a series of short expert presentations that inspire conversation and discussion. Our tastings are facilitated by leaders at the intersection of Textile X Ocean with diverse backgrounds and a passion for knowledge-sharing.On board, you will learn how microfiber pollution is measured, what we know about the potential sources and pathways for fiber pollution in our region, discuss solutions at the forefront of our Textile X Ocean community, and upcoming ways to get involved in furthering research and solutions.Lisa Erdle, 5 Gyres Director of Science and Innovation joined the 2022 sail to help lead a demonstration on techniques to monitor microfiber pollution in water bodies.

With Krystle's background in materials innovation and sustainable textile systems, and Carolynn's background in ocean conservation and plastic pollution, this program merges both of their worlds and expertise.  From hosting an 85 person workshop with NOAA's Marine Debris Program in 2020 and co-authoring the ""California Microfiber Update: Textile Perspective"" to recently co-authoring a congressional report, The Report on Microfiber Pollution, with the EPA Trash Free Waters Program and NOAA's Marine Debris Program on behalf of the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee (IMDCC), Krystle and Carolynn have been able to bring together key learnings from science, industry, government and academia to improve communication cross-discipline and advance toward solutions. In May 2021, Carolynn and Krystle hosted an experiential sail program with local non-profit Fibershed on ""Building Regional Textile Systems For Healthy Soils and Healthy Seas"" on the Call of the Sea's Matthew Turner.  The success of this program was featured in the special Marine Pollution issue of ECO Magazine in October of 2021.From 2021-2022, Carolynn and Krystle served as advisors for the Conservation X Labs Microfiber Innovation Challenge supporting transformative innovations targeting microfiber pollution upstream within the textile industry. I﻿n October 2022, Carolynn and Krystle hosted the inaugural Textile X Ocean Connector sail that brought together 65 participants from more than 35 organizations to participate in a thoughtfully curated program that educated participants and  encouraged collaboration to work towards solutions.  We are honored that our attendees wanted to see us make the Textile X Ocean Connector Sail an annual event!Both Krystle and Carolynn have served on the San Francisco Bay Microplastics Working Group for many years and are active in the ocean conservation space- continuing to find links where they can use their superpowers in connecting passionate people, providing educational opportunities, and fostering creative collaborations to support the development of a blue material world.

Het uitvoeren en controleren van en adviseren over duurzaamheids-analyses en niet-financiële data wordt steeds meer onderdeel van de dagelijkse praktijk van financials. Specifiek is het belangrijk om te weten hoe bedrijven een Green-House-Gas ofwel een CO2-footprint moeten opstellen en wat gebruikelijke standaarden zijn. Maar ook hoe je deze kunt controleren.

ProgrammaDe trainingsdag bestaat uit:1) Een introductie op Green-House-Gasses (GHG).2) Een deepdive in het GHG-protocol, de internationale standaard voor GHG footprint reporting.3) Scoping:  De hele value chain (scope 1, 2 en 3) wordt besproken. Met ruime aandacht voor typische GHG emissiebronnen en -waardes.4) Typische verbetermaatregelen om GHG-emissies te reduceren.5) Aandacht voor controles waarbij we je orde groottes leren ervaren van de uitstoot gerelateerd aan elektriciteitsverbruik, vervoer, inkoop van materiaal en afvalverwerking.De training bestaat afwisselend uit theorie, praktijkvoorbeelden en opdrachten. DocentenPaul van Ruiten is eigenaar van Bureau Om en al meer dan 25 jaar actief in het vakgebied milieu en duurzaamheid en werkte oa als klimaatexpert op de Nederlandse Ambassade in Washington en bij het ministerie in Den Haag.

Hopefully our speaker, if any, will have what to say about that as well ;-)We are always open for anything you want to bring forward, as long as it is inline with making sense & making our planet a better place to live on. Come and try your workshop, show us something cool you have created, anything you like, just contact us and we'll see how we can accommodate you.Agenda for the event:19:00 Walk in(connecting) and get comfortable19:10 Check-in and a short presentation and updates from makesense19:20 Short introduction about the interests of every participant and here each attendee can propose a discussion topic. If we have too many topics we will take a vote to decide which topic to discuss.19:40 We'll start with a few sustainability news or a short presentation on a specific topic20:00 Let's start discussing about the chosen topic !20:45 closing and check-out :)21:00 We can also stay longer if anyone wants to continue the discussion (we often do this and it's fun but it's not a requirement, of course)And if you have ideas or topics that you would like us to address in our events - let's discuss these together - we are open to new events proposals.In fact if any of you are interested, any of you can prepare a 10-20 minute talk/presentation on any given topic ranging from SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) to basically any topic that you think is worth discussing when we think of how to make our planet a bit better. And also at the beginning of the event we will invite everyone to propose discussion topics and then if there are more than 2 we will take a vote as to which topic to discuss.Thank you for your interest :)This week, the event will be hybrid - both in person and online in order to accommodate both options.

8313,A New Landscape: Data Representation and Analysis Workshop,2024-04-04 08:00:00,2024-04-05 16:00:00,"45 Sportlaan, 1185 TB Amstelveen, Netherlands","The focus of this new workshop is the development of children’s emerging ideas and strategies regarding data analysis and representation—arguably one of the most important mathematical strands for the future.There are many ways to represent data and visually communicate relationships, and different models have different assets and limitations to do so. They allow us to see different things and to ask different questions. However, just showing a graph does not mean children are able to “see” the mathematics in it. The mathematics is not in the model to be seen; it is in the child’s mind. For this reason, as we work to develop children’s understanding of data and representation we go back and forth: 1) from the mathematics, to the representation of it; and, 2) from the representation and the questions that arise given the shape of the data, to the mathematics. The tools used initially as models of informal mathematical activity become models for thinking. Over the last two years, Cathy has released 6 new units on the development of data and representation, as well as a new landscape of learning—a learning trajectory comprised of big ideas, strategies, and models based on research on how children come to understand data representation and analysis. The work was co-authored with Koeno Gravemeijer and Frans Van Galen, researchers who previously worked at The Freudenthal Institute in The Netherlands. The workshop will make use of new videos from classrooms, engage participants in analysis of student work, and it will provide rich contexts from children’s lives purposefully crafted to ensure  mathematical development through the K-6 years. Learn about contexts for teaching data and representation that just beg to be mathematized!Empower your students to think like mathematicians using a math workshop modelStudy with Cathy the new Landscape of Learning (learning trajectory) for data representation and analysis.Explore and learn to do minilessons crafted with strings designed to ensure the development of numeracy as it relates to data representation and analysis.Choose a grade span breakout group and learn about investigations that you can do with your students to foster the development of data representation and analysis. Take home a new learning trajectory, a free unit to try with your students, and a month of free access to P2S2: a personalized professional support system from New Perspectives Online.	  	Presenter(s) Bio:Catherine FosnotCathy Fosnot is Professor Emerita of Childhood Education, CCNY/CUNY, where she was the Founding Director of the NSF-funded project Mathematics in the City and was the recipient of the Teacher of the Year Award. She is also an award-winning author of many books, among them: Conferring with Young Mathematicians at Work: Making Moments Matter; Models of Intervention in Mathematics Education: Reweaving the Tapestry (NCTM and Pearson); Young Mathematicians at Work (with Maarten Dolk and Bill Jacob) a series of 4 books on numeracy and algebra published by Heinemann in the U.S. and distributed in Canada by Pearson); Reconstructing Math Education (with Deborah Schifter); and Constructivism: Theory, Perspectives and Practice (Teachers College Press). In 2012 Cathy left the university to establish New Perspectives on Learning, a company focused on professional development and system-wide change, offering professional development workshops and on-site consulting with schools around the world and at the company’s two workshop centers in the U.S. (in New London, CT and San Francisco, CA.). In 2020 she and her team completed Contexts for Learning Mathematics (CFLM), now a full core inquiry-based, hybrid, K-5 program. Over the last several years, the work has expanded with the establishment of two more companies New Perspectives Online, a video-based platform for teacher learning, and New Perspectives on Assessment, a web-based app for formative assessment with teaching implications, aligned with the CCSS. Early in her career, Cathy was the recipient of the Young Scholar Award from the Association for Educational Communication and Technology for her writing on technology and education. The American Educational Research Association Special Interest Group on Constructivism has twice awarded her their “significant contribution” award. She is also the senior content consultant for DreamBox Learning and has been since its inception.

These drones are used in humanitarian and public healthcare contexts in Denmark, Africa, and beyond.  I am interested in utilizing art, craft, and creativity to enhance engineering - and engineering to inform art.  A common theme in my work is the support of de-centralized technologies and democratic, grassroots organizations and methods.  In 2021, I won the Inspiration Prize from my university for my work with the United Nations Sustainable Development goals.  You can read more about my background at this link, see an overview of my projects below, and read about my future work at the bottom of this page.This book presents a holistic approach to the design and use of drones. It argues that this powerful technology requires high levels of ethical analysis and responsibility—our moral progress must keep pace with our technological progress.  Drone technologies support and diminish the flourishing of certain human values, impact power relations between individuals and groups, and add an additional element to the complex network of humans and objects in modern society. The book begins by introducing four prototype drones designed and built by the author: the healthcare drone, the search and rescue drone, the mapping drone, and the spiritual drone. After presenting the technological aspects of each drone, the author considers their social contexts and ethical aspects. What is the use plan of each drone? Where will it operate? Will it support the flourishing of humans and of nature? Should this drone be built? The next part of the book showcases several methods used to develop the prototype drones from the fields of engineering, ethics, and art: value sensitive design, ethical frameworks, capability caution, and speculative design. These methods reveal a more subtle and nuanced view of drones than the currently polarized characterization of “the good drone” or “the killer drone”. The book concludes with specific recommendations for drone engineers, companies, lawmakers, and citizens.F﻿urther information can be found here.A﻿bout the Robotics InstituteTU Delft Robotics Institute unites all Delft University of Technology’s research in the field of robotics. Its main challenge is to get robots and humans to work together effectively in unstructured environments, and real settings.Within the institute both the ‘hard’ robot disciplines (mechatronics, embedded systems, control and Artificial Intelligence) and the ‘soft’ robot sciences (human-machine interaction, user interaction, architecture, ethics, security and design) have a prominent presence. By joining forces, and aligning research, education and valorisation, TU Delft Robotics Institute takes a leading role in the creation of the next generation robots.F﻿urther information can be found here.About the Delft Design for Values InstituteDesign for Values is aimed at systematically integrating values of moral importance in the design of products, services and systems from the start of the design process. The institute focuses on a broad range of values including safety, sustainability, privacy, justice & fairness, diversity & inclusion, and well-being, as well as on a wide range of domains and applications areas, like smart cities, healthcare, water management, infrastructure, energy, and consumer products.The Delft Design for Values Institute (DDfV) brings together expertise in design and (moral) values and is a collaboration between five faculties: TPM, IDE, BK, CTIG and EEMCS. DDfV is directed by prof. dr. ir. Ibo van de Poel. The Management Board consists of representatives of the five participating faculties: Carola Hein/Rachel Lee (BK), Edo Abraham (CiTG), Marina Bos–De Vos (IDE), Megha Khosla (EEMCS), and Michael Klenk (TBM) and Marielle Feenstra (TBM – Coordination DDfV), and Maria Novas Ferradas (BK – Coordination DDfV).The institute has formulated the following four ambitions for the next five years:Consolidating DDfV as an international leading knowledge institute in the field of design and values,Acquiring external funding for interdisciplinary research on Design for Values,Integrating Design for Values in educational programs at the TU Delft,Increasing external visibility through an annual theme.For 2023 the annual theme is Design for Justice.If you have questions or are interested in our activities, you can reach us at info@delftdesignforvalues.nlF﻿urther information can be found here ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/design-for-values-institute-63508538483,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/playground-session-on-the-ethics-of-drone-design-tickets-675002389317,Amsterdam

This is the seventh Silicon Valley Foresight Four Seminar Series featuring solutions to advance the goal of a sustainable future with Net Zero emissions by 2050. Innovation in Materials for the Circular EconomyThe goal of the Circular Economy is to solve problems including climate change, pollution and environmental degradation. This can be accomplished by stepping back from the conventional approach for how we make things today to inventing new materials, methods and designs that plan ahead for using non-toxic ingredients to make the products we use every day and to design them so that they can be recovered and reused or deconstructed and reconstructed into new products enabling the materials to be used over and over again, without creating waste.  We will discuss: ➢	What is the circular economy and what are its benefits?➢	Who is innovating in this area and their examples?➢	What are the opportunities for the future of material science?➢	How can we accelerate the transition to circular materials?Additional Information on the Circular Economy:According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation one of the leaders in this field: “In our current economy, we take materials from the Earth, make products from them, and eventually throw them away as waste – the process is linear. In a circular economy, by contrast, we stop waste being produced in the first place. The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design:●	Eliminate waste and pollution●	Circulate products and materials (at their highest value)●	Regenerate natureIt is underpinned by a transition to renewable energy and materials. A circular economy decouples economic activity from the consumption of finite resources. It is a resilient system that is good for business, people and the environment.”Date:		Monday, August 7, 2023Time:	   5:30 PM - 7:30 PM (Registration and networking begin at 5:00PM)Location: Plug and Play Tech Center, 440 N Wolfe Rd, Sunnyvale, CA 94085Cost:		Free but registration is requiredYou will have an opportunity to network in person to share your thoughts and experiences with peers and to speak in-depth with each of the panelists after the formal presentation, while enjoying refreshments.Agenda:5:00 - 5:30 PM  -Registration, Networking5:30 - 7:00 PM  -Panel Presentations, Q&A7:00 - 7:30 PM -NetworkingSpeakers/Panelists:	Dr. William Tarpeh, Assistant Professor, Chemical Engineering, and Civil and Environmental Engineering, Center Fellow at the Precourt Institute For Energy, and the Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford UniversityJesse Simons, Co-Founder and CCO, SolarcycleGeoff Chapin, CEO, CarbonwaveMichael Matthews, Commercial Plant Project Manager, Mango Materials

Carbonwave’s products help reduce and offset emissions from fossil fuels and traditional plastics, while minimizing waste. Their seaweed derived fertilizers and plant performance boosters help soils and crops overcome challenges from environmental stresses like heatwaves, droughts, and soil exhaustion. They are creating a plant-based fabric that relies on the extraction of structural polymers to form films stronger than the seaweed itself and competitive with the strength of other vegan textiles, without relying on polyurethane (PU) plastic for structure and strength. Their SeaBalance line of broad-spectrum emulsifiers have a wide range of applications across cosmetics and skin-care products. Unlike emulsifiers used in cosmetics and personal health that are often made with harmful fossil fuel derivatives, SeaBalance utilizes an all-natural process to make an emulsifier that’s healthy to use, and healthy for the planet. C-Combinator emulsifiers are versatile by nature: they work with formulations ranging from pH 3.5 to pH 9, and are capable of emulsifying a wide variety of oils between 10% to 40% oil content.Michael Matthews is the Commercial Plant Project Manager for Mango Materials. He has experience managing engineering design/analysis, site selection, permitting, and construction of commercial plants, He leads a team of engineers, scientists, operators and supporting staff on the scale up of Mango Materials' novel methane-to-PHA technology.  Before Mango Materials he worked for Ensol Systems, Solaris MCI, and Shell. He earned a bachelor’s in engineering from Dalhousie University and is certified as a California Mechanical Engineer and Professional Engineer (PE). He follows a collaborative and dynamic approach to leadership.About Mango Materials: Mango Materials is a renewable bioproducts company dedicated to developing environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional plastics and polyesters by fermenting and transforming waste methane to produce biopolymers which are then used to create biodegradable products. Mango Materials transforms waste gas streams into affordable, biodegradable materials while creating a positive environmental impact. It produces  naturally occurring biopolymers from waste biogas (methane) that are economically competitive with conventional oil-based materials.They are currently focused on producing Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) which are a potential replacement for some petrochemical-based plastics. They are producing PHA from waste methane gas at a San Francisco Bay Area wastewater treatment plant. PHA is  a family of biopolyesters that can be produced naturally by bacteria and other life forms. PHB is one of the many types of PHA. Unlike PLA and other biopolymers, PHA can biodegrade in many environments, including the oceans. YOPP pellets can be used in injection molding, fiber extrusion, additive manufacturing, and other plastic substitute applications. YOPP and YOPP+ pellets are optimally-formulated for fibers (for apparel and textiles) and rigid goods (for jars, caps, and molded applications). (YOPP is a trade name that stands for “You Oust Polluting Plastics”.)

Indeed, healthy riparian ecosystems promote ecological and climate resilience both within and beyond riparian zones, lead to the accrual and sequestration of carbon and nitrogen in soil, absorb heat and buffer organisms against extreme temperatures. Cascade Ranch is within an area of high biological richness and surrounded by California protected areas. About 1.2 miles of Cascade Creek fall within the boundaries of the property, which is currently managed by the non-profit Pie Ranch. Cascade Creek represents an important habitat connectivity area for a wide array of plants and animals and a potential traditional food source for people. Unfortunately, the riparian zone has been highly affected by the spreading of invasive plant species, which are causing loss of biodiversity and related ecosystem services and products. The 2020 CZU complex fire has further contributed to the increase in number, variety and spread of invasive species along Cascade Creek.Your hard work and participation will help shape the future of this land!

Een snelgroeiend bedrijf dat industrieel energiemodules produceert voor zeer energiezuinige woningen.De winst van biobased bouwen voor boer en bouw - Als we de klimaatdoelen van Parijs willen halen én snel 900.000 woningen willen bouwen, dan moeten we de bouwsector, de landbouw en de industrie versneld verduurzamen. Biogrondstoffen vormen hiervoor de sleutel. Jan Willem van de Groep vertelt wat er nodig is om dat voor elkaar te krijgen en op welke manier de bouw en landbouw elkaar wederzijds kunnen versterken bij het bereiken van klimaat- en natuurdoelen. Op dit moment werkt Jan Willem aan: Een programma dat biobased bouwen moet stimuleren, versnellen en opschalen in opdracht van het ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit.Een onderzoek naar digitalisering van de renovatie- en verduurzamingsketen in opdracht van TKI urban energyEen programma voor een verduurzamingsaanpak van particulier woningbezit in opdracht van de Agem en de regio Achterhoek.Een kwartiermakersproject voor de uitrol van de contingentenaanpak voor het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koningkrijsrelaties in opdracht van TKI-urban energyHet opzetten van GIDEON – Building Transition Tribe, een transitiebeweging die koplopers in de bouw moet helpen sneller op te schalen.VISIEDe bouwsector verandert de komende jaren razendsnel. Van een traditionele bouwnijverheid naar een slimme en hoogtechnologische bouwindustrie. Nieuwe (productie) technologieën, (biobased)materialen en software staan aan de basis van nieuwe mogelijkheden. Jan Willem verbindt de opgaven die spelen binnen de overlappende domeinen bouwen, wonen, landbouw en energie met die ontluikende bouwindustrie. De noodzakelijke en onontkoombare beweging naar innovatie en industrialisatie in de bouw  illustreert hij in zijn presentaties. Hij wordt regelmatig gevraagd als adviseur en/of spreker voor bedrijven, woningcorporaties en overheden vanwege zijn visie op de energietransitie en de daaraan gekoppelde transitie van de bouwsector.",https://www.eventbrite.nl/o/ekwadraat-28760009623,https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-jan-willem-van-de-groep-de-winst-van-biobased-bouwen-voor-boer-en-bouw-668769085337,Amsterdam

Het team werd opgericht in 2007 en heeft sindsdien verschillende waterstofraceauto's ontwikkeld en deelgenomen aan verschillende races en evenementen. Aansluitend geven zij een lezing met als thema: ""Driving the energy transition with hydrogen racing"".  Deze lezing wordt gegeven door Eva van der Dijs, teammanager Forze Hydrogen Racing team 17. De Forze VIII is gebaseerd op een bestaande sportwagen. Het is een krachtige raceauto met een waterstofbrandstofcel en een elektrische aandrijving. De brandstofcel zet waterstof om in elektriciteit, waardoor de auto snelheid en vermogen krijgt. Het heeft ook een batterijpakket om energie op te slaan en te gebruiken tijdens acceleratie en piekvermogen.De Forze VIII werd de eerste waterstofraceauto in de geschiedenis die deelnam aan een door de FIA gecertificeerde race. Op 18 augustus 2018 nam ze deel aan de sportdivisie van de Supercar Challenge tegen benzine-aangedreven supercars.In augustus 2019 vierde Forze haar grootste prestatie tot nu toe. De Forze VIII nam opnieuw deel aan de Supercar Challenge tijdens de Gamma Racing Days en eindigde als tweede in onze klasse. Dit succes benadrukte de capaciteit van het team en maakt ons nog enthousiaster over wat de toekomst voor ons in petto heeft.Op het circuit van Zandvoort heeft de Forze VIII het officiële ronderecord voor elektrische sportwagens met 1:55.809 tijdens een test waarbij de omstandigheden verre van ideaal waren. Op het TT Circuit Assen is het onofficiële ronderecord van de Forze VIII 1:56.958.",https://www.eventbrite.nl/o/ekwadraat-28760009623,https://www.eventbrite.nl/e/tickets-lezing-tu-delft-driving-the-energy-transition-with-hydrogen-racing-668836858047,Amsterdam

These structures have significant effects on the ecology of marine habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. For example, seawalls are generally homogenous and steep. Due to these differences, artificial defences are poor surrogates for the habitats they replace. Ecological engineering—the integration of ecological principles and engineering for the benefit of both humans and nature—is a form of Nature Based Solution that is being increasingly adopted to alleviate the negative impacts associated with coastal defences by improving their ecological functioning. One of the more successful eco-engineering strategies is to add tiles with complex topographies, microhabitats, and water-retaining features. These can increase the richness and abundance of species reminiscent of native communities. Moving forward, how can we incorporate habitat complexity and green elements into new coastal defence designs, and what additional benefits may they be able to provide?About the host: Dr Peter Todd is an experimental marine ecologist who focusses urban marine systems. He works on increasing understanding of the ecology and functioning of tropical coastal marine organisms and communities under environmental stress. His research is multidisciplinary, synthesising elements of biology, geography and engineering to answer ecological questions. His team has 18 years of experience in the conceptualisation, build, implementation, and analysis of novel experiments, and over a decade designing and testing a wide range of seawall enhancements. Dr Todd is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, where he runs the Experimental Marine Ecology Laboratory and is director of the Bachelor of Environmental Studies programme. He has published over 150 peer-reviewed papers on coastal systems and his lab’s research is featured regularly in both local and international media.

Participants leave understanding that clothes, the ocean, and their internal worlds are so closely intertwined, and become better able to choose clothing that minimises damage to the ocean.  About the host: Leading the talk will be 2022 National Geographic Explorer Thammika Songkaeo, the co-founder of Two Glasses LLP, a Singapore-based company that tackles environmental problems in multidisciplinary ways. She has a grant from National Geographic Society to produce ‘Changing Room’, a dance film that investigates how body criticism and human insecurities are related to fashion overconsumption and climate change.

Recent events like the Canadian wildfire smoke demonstrate how air quality gains can be eroded by climate change, having a disproportionate impact on communities already struggling with heat, air quality concerns, and their associated health impacts. What is government doing to address these risks and get at the root causes of our climate crisis? How can community organizations and residents partner with local businesses, academic organizations, and government to cause real change in policy and outcomes?

In de Makerspace van CODA ExperienceLab ga je aan de slag met de natuurlijke materialen die in het lab aanwezig zijn. We gaan aan de slag met verschillende manieren om stof voor te behandelen om te experimenteren met de verschillende effecten.  Je leert hoe je een verfbad maakt en hoe je een katoenen of zijden lap stof daarmee kunt verven. Heb je de perfecte kleur gevonden dan start je met het verven van stof voor een sjaal. Verf de stof in een egale kleur of maak een print met een tie-dye of Shibori-techniek. Voor het verven worden geen chemicaliën gebruikt, alleen natuurlijke producten. Wil je meedoen? Neem dan een schort en/of plastic handschoenen mee om je kleding en handen te beschermen.

8341,Libraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment,2023-08-19 09:00:00,2023-08-19 18:00:00,"1000 Burgemeester Brokxlaan, 5041 SG Tilburg, Netherlands","The IFLA Environment, Sustainability and Libraries Section (ENSULIB) together with the Public Libraries Section (PLS) in collaboration with Bibliotheek Midden-Brabant, LocHal are organising a satellite conference prior to the IFLA World Library and Information Congress 2023 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The focus will be on “Libraries as Actors of Climate Empowerment”. Libraries can empower all members of society to engage in climate action. They are deeply connected to their communities and can reach people of all demographics. As such, they are in a unique position to provide public awareness and to create platforms for engagement in climate action for all members of society. This one-day conference will emphasise exchange and interaction between participants. Participants will play an active role in shaping the outcome of the day by coming together, sharing ideas and developing plans. With a mix of keynotes, lightning talks and workshops, it will be an interactive, engaging and inspiring day. Programme9.00 – Registration & Coffee9.30 –  Keynote:  Ton van Vlimmeren (Netherlands) – Libraries Building Sustainable CommunitiesTon van Vlimmeren is the President of the European Library Organization (EBLIDA), member of the Standing Committee of the Metropolitan Libraries Section of IFLA and one of the founders of Public Libraries 2030. This keynote will highlight how the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help libraries on their journey towards a sustainable, inclusive, and democratic society10.20 – Lightning Talks: STRATEGIES & CHALLENGES: IMPLEMENTING SDGS IN LIBRARIESMinna Männikkö (Finland) – Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap: Climate Action in Oulu, Finland In 2020, Oulu City Library implemented a Sustainable Library 2030 Roadmap. Based on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the roadmap defines key development areas and sets out implementation plans. It focuses on promoting environmental awareness, reducing environmental impact and responsible construction, with the aim that sustainable development permeates all areas of the library’s daily work. This presentation will outline the roadmap and how it is being used as a long-term tool for climate action in Oulu City Library in Finland.Sarah Tribelhorn (USA) – Bringing the SDGs Alive in an Academic LibraryThe San Diego State University Library has mapped its work to the SDGs through a comprehensive analysis of employee roles, projects, and the library website. The process culminated in an exhibition that led to an engaging community discussion and challenged students, staff, and faculty to think critically about how they can contribute to these goals. This presentation will describe the process as a catalyst for community engagement, partnerships, and empowerment around climate awareness and the SDGs.Nathalice Bezerra Cardoso (Brazil) – Challenges of the SDGs: Case Study of the German LibrariesThe SDGs have gained prominence in recent years, and there has been increased discussion on the role and social responsibilities of libraries regarding this issue. This presentation will provide an understanding of how German libraries are contributing to the SDGs. Do the people who are working in the libraries know what the SDGs are about?? Which SDGs are addressed by German public libraries? What services and actions are being developed in German libraries to achieve the SDGs?11.00 –  Coffee Break 11.30 – Workshops Workshop 1: Beth Filar Williams (USA) – Inner Development Goals: A Collaborative Exploration WorkshopThe Inner Development Goals (IDGs) are a framework for accelerating our work towards the SDGs, co-created by diverse, international experts in response to current crises. The IDGs can help us access the deep level beneath the structures so that we can work on ourselves and how we relate to others, care for the world and create change. Participants will be invited to explore this framework in small groups – shifting awareness, connecting with each other and the earth. Workshop 2: Liselotte Dessauvagie (Netherlands) – SDGs Bookclub: For a Better Future!An SDGs Bookclub is an annotated list of selected books that teachers and librarians can use to discuss and explore the SDGs with children (and adults). Suggestions for teaching will accompany the book selection. In this workshop, the Dutch version of the SDGs Bookclub will be presented and the selection will be discussed. Participants will work on a small SDGs Bookclub during the session and explore how the SDGs can help build a better future for all through books.Workshop 3: Daniel Hackborn (Canada) – MACK Framework: Situating Climate Action in Local Library ContextsWhile anthropogenic global warming is inherently a global issue demanding systemic action, developing responses at a local institutional level can be overwhelming. In this workshop, we will introduce the Mitigation-Adaptation-Community-Knowledge (MACK) conceptual model and, using Amiskwaciwâskahikan (Edmonton), Canada as a guiding case study, illustrate how this model can be applied to other local libraries in order to clarify and analyse their potential opportunities for climate action.12.30 – Lunch Break (included in registration) 13.30 –  Keynote: Jantien Borsboom, Pieternel Thijssen (Netherlands) – Community participation in the SDGsSince 2016, the SDGs have been a framework for the library of Midden-Brabant. In this keynote, we will tell the story of how the SDGs became a guiding principle for the library. They are now one of the four impact chains. The library of Midden-Brabant has developed a method to work with communities on societal issues, such as the SDGs. We will share how the LocHal library worked offline and online with the community around urban nature, reaching more than 25,000 people.14.10 – Lighting Talks and Workshop: INSPIRE & EMPOWER: EXAMPLES ACROSS THE GLOBEPriscilla Pun (China) – 10 Ways to Make Your Library Green This presentation will provide examples of libraries as actors and educators for sustainable development, in line with ENSULIB’s definition of a Green Library. Examples include creating and promoting shared resources or facilities (sharing economy), reducing consumption, using environmentally friendly library buildings and equipment, and demonstrating commitment to international environmental goals and programmes.Tim Schumann (Germany) – The Berlin-Pankow Public Library Going Green The Berlin-Pankow Public Library is on its way to become a Green Library by embracing its role as an actor in an ecologically and socially sustainable future. This presentation will describe current measures of the library in terms of diversity, management, and partnerships, becoming a third place in the community, and how this relates to its goal of becoming a Green Library.Workshop: Helena Öberg Carlsson (Sweden) – Transition Stories Beyond Dystopia and Carbon RuinsThrough storytelling and sharing experiences, we can foster a sense of belonging and collective agency for change. This workshop is based on a scientific master narrative that has been used as a spinning wheel for a dynamic process involving public libraries in Västmanland County, Lund University, artists and local stakeholders, where it has initiated a process to reveal the potential of public libraries as arenas for transition and change.15.30 – Coffee Break15.50 – Panel Discussion and Closing:  CLIMATE ACTION: COUNT LIBRARIES IN!A panel of library leaders from around the world will come together to share and discuss the role of libraries as actors of climate empowerment.16.30 – Self-guided Tour of LocHal and Social GatheringM﻿ore information can be found on our website:https://www.ifla.org/events/ifla-wlic-satellite-meeting-2023-libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment/ ",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/bibliotheek-midden-brabant-and-ensulib-pls-64783058103,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/libraries-as-actors-of-climate-empowerment-tickets-623591016517,Amsterdam

This history is ongoing and is combined with oppressive financial structures (based in colonialism and racism) which put the Global South in debt to the Global North.·	   The concept of Loss and Damage, referring to a concept adopted in the United Nations climate talks at the urging of the Global South. Its implementation will be a key issue in the UN climate talks moving forward.·	   Why resources to solve the climate crisis are only available in the Global North and some ideas on how it is possible to access these funds.·	   What are the underlying human patterns of behavior that underlie the confusions in our society that have created the current crises? There is internal work that the people of the Global North need to do to accept their historical responsibility and back the Global South to develop just proposals which redress the current economic inequality and disparate impact of the climate crisis.",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/sustaining-all-life-67466229743,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/how-the-global-north-can-take-responsibility-for-the-climate-crisis-and-act-tickets-676187664507,NYC

After reading a 2050 newspaper reporting the extreme weather and “how we got here”, specialist and non-specialist stakeholders will delve into narrative and ethical arguments, explore trade-offs, and critically examine societal pathways and obstacles to a resilient energy mix.  The 3-hour in-person workshop will be very interactive, engaging group discussions, cooperative deliberation, and collaborative tasks.B﻿ackgroundAccording to the IPCC, before 2035 the average temperature on Earth is projected to surpass the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark above pre-industrial levels. Climate scientists have warned that the probability of climate extremes increases with every tenth of a degree of warming. Innovation and disruptive climate events will have increasingly significant impact on both daily life and energy sources, with new evolutions in economic, social, and environmental factors driving energy demand. By projecting ourselves now into 2050, can we perceive more clearly what societal responses should be?  Scenario tools provide a context for exploring a range of possible future outcomes.

8674,Net Zero Nations Projects Conference,2023-11-15 08:30:00,2023-11-15 16:00:00,"1 Great George Street Westminster, London, SW1P 3AA, United Kingdom","We are at a crossroads in our historyAs we recover from the impact of the pandemic on our lives and livelihoods, we know that it will not be enough to go back to the way things were before.The science is clear, we know that human activity is changing our climate and that this will have a devastating impact on human lives, the economy, and the natural world – ranging from the extinction of some species and the melting of ice caps to extreme weather patterns threatening our homes, businesses, and communities. Energy security and net zero are two sides of the same coin. The energy transition and net zero are among the greatest opportunities facing this country and we are committed to ensuring that the UK takes advantage of its early mover status. Global action to mitigate climate change is essential to long term prosperity – the overall costs and risks of global warming to be equivalent to losing between 5% and 20% of global GDP each year.After decades of reliance on imported fossil fuels, the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s mission is to replace them with cheaper, cleaner, domestic sources of energy. In response to high household energy bills resulting from Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the government stepped in, paying around half of the average household’s energy bills over winter and around half of wholesale energy costs for some businesses. But the way to maintain lower cost energy for everyone is to move to cleaner and cheaper energy to protect us from volatile international energy markets, while underpinning our clean energy transition, so the UK becomes a net zero economy by 2050. It will also help us make sure Britain has among the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe by 2035. The UK has already made huge progress in decarbonising its economy and decoupling emissions from economic growth. Thanks to the Climate Change Act (2008) and Environment Act (2021), we have a strong legal framework for reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Between 1990 and 2021, we have cut our emissions by 48%, decarbonising faster than any other G7 country, whilst growing the economy by 65%. The UK was also the first G7 country to sign net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 into law. The UK’s strategy for net-zero is to lead the world in ending our contribution to climate change while turning this mission into the greatest opportunity for jobs and prosperity for our country since the industrial revolution.Removing dirty fossil fuels from the global economy will lead to the creation of vast new global industries from offshore wind to electric vehicles and carbon capture and storage. By moving first and making the United Kingdom the birthplace of the Green Industrial Revolution we are building a defining competitive edge. The changes will have wider benefits for the public and businesses alike. We will all enjoy cleaner air, increased biodiversity and improved access to green spaces. We will see greater efficiency in the way we travel and heat our buildings, which will be better protected from more extreme weather events. We will also put consumers at the heart of this transition, helping them make their homes warmer, and more efficient, and ensure that they pay a fair, affordable price for their energy.In 2050, we will still be driving cars, flying planes and heating our homes, but our cars will be electric gliding silently around our cities, our planes will be zero-emission allowing us to fly guilt-free, and our homes will be heated by cheap reliable power drawn from the winds of the North Sea. And everywhere you look, in every part of our United Kingdom, there will be jobs. Good jobs, green jobs, well-paid jobs, levelling up our country while squashing down our carbon emissions. That is the clean and prosperous future that awaits every one of us as the UK leads the world in the race to net zero. But we cannot tackle climate change alone. We will need to take a coordinated approach, working across local and national government, the devolved administrations, and with businesses and civil society organisations. And we will need to make it easier and fairer for individuals, businesses and households to decarbonise so that our whole society can work together to reduce emissions. Don’t miss this fantastic opportunity to attend the conference and hear from those leading on the net-zero agenda by highlighting key examples of case studies and projects from around the world using new innovations and technologies which can help accelerate the transition to a net-zero nation by 2050.Join us on the 15th of Novembner 2023 for the Net Zero Nations Projects Conference.Get Involved, We All Have A Part to Play…..Find Yours!",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/evolutional-events-44657800583,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/net-zero-nations-projects-conference-registration-670628737607,London

As social and ecological crises escalate globally, it is clear that the dominant cultural worldview, informed by colonization, patriarchy, capitalism, and racism is displaying a relationship with Nature and each other that is devastatingly unjust and out of balance. To live in a healthy and equitable world, we must fundamentally change how we respect and interact with the Earth and one another. To change the present and future, it is imperative to change the narrative and amplify worldviews and stories of climate justice solutions that transform the dominant worldview from an extractivist, colonial paradigm of “exploit and extract” to a sustainable, globally-conscious one of “respect and restore.”At this event, movement leaders and change-makers will weave together stories, worldviews, and experiences of restoration and justice that demonstrate the healthy and equitable world we know is possible and needed. We knew in our bones this time was coming, and now we must act in solidarity more than ever, continuing to build a powerful movement founded on principles of justice, love, and a fierce dedication to our planet and our communities.This event is also the pre-launch of the forthcoming book by Osprey Orielle Lake, ""The Story is in Our Bones: How Worldviews and Climate Justice Can Remake a World in Crisis,"" to be released in January 2024.  Abundant hors d’oeuvres and drinks will be served.

Disability is the part of an identity that gets left out because no one wants to think it matters and everyone is afraid a disability could happen to them. Inclusion of people with disabilities is a key issue in climate policy.Having a disability is part of the human condition and disabled people form a subset of every community.  Many of us lead interesting, productive, and fulfilling lives. We are problem solvers and have figured out creative ways using technology and other assistive accommodations to manage and sustain our bodies and our minds. People with disabilities are uniquely impacted by climate change due to a lack of resources and because policy makers don’t understand what we need to survive in environmentally compromised circumstances. In this workshop participants will: ·	   Recognize the contributions by people with disabilities who have led the fight and advocated for laws, such as 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, that have led to greater accessibility and inclusion throughout society, ·	   Learn about disability oppression and how it plays out in unintended ways.  ·	   Examine the manifestations of disability oppression in the environmental movement and the impact of climate change on this population, ·	   Learn about issues such as extreme heat, lack of effective communication, decrease in clean water, and loss of electricity, that have disastrous effects on the well-being of people with disabilities,·	   Learn about the theory and practice the tools of Sustaining All Life as strategies to overcome the effects of disability oppression in our individual lives and societies. In Sustaining All Life we work to (1) create awareness of the emotional feelings that interfere with fresh thinking about and acting to environmental degradation and (2) undo this damage on an individual basis. We offer mutual support, engaged listening, and a process to help people work against the effects of oppression and other hurts. Using this process allows us to think more clearly about the environmental crisis, build and strengthen alliances, and enjoy working together to set the world right. Together, we can create a just, sustainable future for everyone.

Urbanization, population growth, and climate change have led to challenges with solid and hazardous waste generation and disposal, and has put stress on water resources. This year’s lab investigates the ways that designers, artists, creative technologists, policy makers, activists, and educators are working to deal with these impacts and what projects are being undertaken to mitigate these risks. The statistics outline a worsening situation.Globally the average person generates 1.6 lbs of waste per day and total waste will rise as the world’s population increases. Even as waste treatment methods have improved, a lot of waste ends up in dump sites and only “20 percent of waste is recycled each year” (Alves, 2023). Hazardous waste, which is especially harmful – coming from dyes, metals in batteries and electronics, and solvents – suffers from inadequate household awareness and lack of industry compliance. Clean water and water systems are taken for granted in many parts of society just as many rivers and lakes have “dried up” or have become “too polluted to use” — and it is expected that by 2025, “two-thirds of the world’s population may face water shortages.” (WWF, 2023).

Through myth making and tool use, they facilitate small groups in building bridges from land to sea, imagining sustainable ecologies.With the aim to cultivate space for collective trust and shared dreaming, Tree+Oyster arrive with non verbal communication and play to shed anthropocentric perspective and facilitate opportunities for emergent ritual.Tree+Oyster merge archipelagic Indigenous mythologies from the Dominican Republic and the Philippines in order to stoke memory, resist erasure, and generate new mythologies. With curiosity to discover cross-cultural parallels in land-water relationship between Indigenous communities and their own personal decolonization research, T+O engage in immersive research deepening their relationship to land and community. From this foundation, they facilitate creative gatherings bridging inner and outer ecologies — a practice in tuning our personal, communal, and digital relationship to the landscape.Site-specific gatherings consist of co-creation exercises and games, sensorial ceremonies, body mapping, collective altar building, and musical forest jams. Seasonal elements, i.e. sand, soil, and vegetation, inform the location and structure of interactive installations. These onsite activations create a generative mediated space for communal storytelling. Rooted in the study of Indigenous histories, local-to-global community, and ecology, Tree+Oyster aim to build a cross-cultural campfire generating warmth, in empathetic pursuit of sustainability.Tree/ Tree.ceo is the performance art and design project of Ana Vásquez, in which she appropriates means of performance marketing to co-create regenerative loops and funnels that supplant cultural erasure. Informed by her practice as an Emergent Strategy facilitator, new media artist, and brand designer, her Dominican background serves as a starting point for stoking Pre-Columbian collective memory. She employs soft power to explore intersectional myth-making and tool-building for lush ecosystems.Jennae “Oyster” Santos is a music and performance artist and Babaylanic student born in the Bay Area (Ohlone territory) and based in Brooklyn (Lenapehoking territory), with ancestral roots across the Philippines archipelago. In infinite collaborative incarnations, she helms progressive art rock project gushes— songwriting and composition rooted in rhythmic guitar loops and ritualized theatre with a stylistic range encompassing chamber rock ensemble, experimental drone, movement cycle, sound sculpture, and more. Santos’ work is influenced by Indigenous Filipino psychology, Kali as a decolonized combat art, the feminist occult, plant medicine and ecology, BIPOC land revolution movements, genderqueer fluidity, and pleasure autonomy.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/flux-factory-66821397293,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/treeoyster-tickets-667176742597,NYC

Many of the events and organizations we are working with have already cancelled, postponed, or significantly scaled back the physical events they had planned for the first half of 2022, to help mitigate the spread of COVID.Keeping in line with the guidance we are hearing from other professional event planning organizations, we have made the difficult decision to postpone our ""Exploring the Metaverse"" return to physical events. It had originally been planned for March 2, but will be postponed to a later date. We hope to be able to host this event in 2022, and will reserve the topic of the Metaverse for a date when we can return to physical in-person meetings. However, we feel at this time it is best for our audience, presenters, partners and staff to prioritize everybody's health and safety. Details:Is this the Metaverse? Is this just Fantasy?The idea of ‘The Metaverse’ is expansive, still evolving, and not collectively agreed upon yet. It has many of us scratching our heads and coming up with a slew of existential questions.

The event will also streamed on Facebook.com/VRARChicago  (facebook.com/VRARChicago/live_videos/).The virtual environment resembles a physical space, so you will be able to talk with other attendees during open networking both before and after the presentations.

Want to dive deeper into building a vision for transformative climate reparations? Want to see that collective vision turned into a piece of artwork for an upcoming exhibition on the topic? Join us for a workshop in London on Saturday 26th August. This interactive workshop will reflect on  the history of the colonial debt crisis, what it means for our wider movements, and how we can work together to support each other’s campaigns. We will explore the concept of climate reparations and how debt justice can be part of a broader agenda to repair the harm faced by communities around the world. As part of the workshop, we’ll be co-creating an artistic response to the topic to be displayed at an exhibition on debt, colonialism, and the climate crisis at Peckham Levels in November 2023. If you don’t consider yourself an artist, don’t worry - we still want you to come along and input into our shared vision for change. Right now, 54 countries are in debt crisis, with the need to make repayments stopping them from investing in healthcare, education, and responding to the climate crisis. This is not an accident. For centuries, powerful governments, institutions and corporations have used debt to control and plunder the resources of countries in the global south for their own gain. At the same time, countries and communities in the global south are disproportionately facing the impacts of the climate crisis.From colonial powers forcing countries into debt at the point of independence, to allowing corporations like BlackRock to continue to make huge profits from debt repayments today, we can’t build new visions of reparative justice without understanding the roots of the crisis we face.When: Saturday 26th August 2023, 2pm-5pm.Where: Dance Hall, Waterloo Action Centre, SE1 7AAAccess information: Wheelchair access, accessible toilets. The accessible toilet is gender neutral. Please get in touch with any other access requirements (e.g. hearing loop, quiet space, etc) and we’ll do our best to accommodate you.

Simply that our most important task is to get off our present collision course. And who is there to tackle such a task? I think every one of us, whether old or young, powerful or powerless, rich or poor, influential or un-influential.”- E.F. Schumacher. First Annual Small is Beautiful Lecture:The Next 50 yearsOn the 50th anniversary of E.F. Schumacher's seminal work Small is Beautiful, the core idea of his work — a placed-based economy in sync with living ecosystems and social needs — is as urgent and relevant as it has ever been. To honour Schumacher's ideas and move them forward in our time of ecological crisis and economic overreach, we feel the time is right for a Schumacher-inspired center in the Netherlands.  “An ounce of practice is generally worth more than a ton of theory.”With an emphasis on the actionable, we envision a physical transformative space, a LAB, where a diversity of individuals, groups and organisations can explore, build and further the new ideas, social practices, technologies and policies for building a new type of society. The center will draw on the special contributions of arts and culture, economics, ecological sciences, and personal development.To help kick off a wider public consideration of Schumacher NL, we are proud to announce that commons activist and scholar David Bollier will deliver the first annual Small Is Beautiful Lecture at the Kleine Aarde in Boxtel on September 14, 2023.  David is Director of the Reinventing the Commons Program at the Schumacher Center for a New Economics in Massachusetts, United States. De Kleine Aarde, as a contemporary model, breathes Schumacher's work.  Hereby, we cordially invite you to be part of  our common movement. The afternoon is an active invitation to help build Schumacher NL  and will offer room for dialogue, initiative building, and connecting . Please join us.

About A DARKER WILDERNESS:A vibrant collection of personal and lyric essays in conversation with archival objects of Black history and memory.What are the politics of nature? Who owns it, where is it, what role does it play in our lives? Does it need to be tamed? Are we ourselves natural? In A Darker Wilderness, a constellation of luminary writers reflect on the significance of nature in their lived experience and on the role of nature in the lives of Black folks in the United States. Each of these essays engages with a single archival object, whether directly or obliquely, exploring stories spanning hundreds of years and thousands of miles, traveling from roots to space and finding rich Blackness everywhere.Erin Sharkey considers Benjamin Banneker’s 1795 almanac, as she follows the passing of seasons in an urban garden in Buffalo. Naima Penniman reflects on a statue of Haitian revolutionary François Makandal, within her own pursuit of environmental justice. Ama Codjoe meditates on rain, hair, protest, and freedom via a photo of a young woman during a civil rights demonstration in Alabama. And so on—with wide-ranging contributions from Carolyn Finney, Ronald Greer II, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Sean Hill, Michael Kleber-Diggs, Glynn Pogue, Katie Robinson, and Lauret Savoy—unearthing evidence of the ways Black people’s relationship to the natural world has persevered through colonialism, slavery, state-sponsored violence, and structurally racist policies like Jim Crow and redlining.A scrapbook, a family chest, a quilt—and an astounding work of historical engagement and literary accomplishment—A Darker Wilderness is a collection brimming with abundance and insight.A Darker Wilderness is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!

A Vagrant, there was Katie Beaton of the Cape Breton Beaton, specifically Mabou, a tight-knit seaside community where the lobster is as abundant as beaches, fiddles, and Gaelic folk songs. With the singular goal of paying off her student loans, Katie heads out west to take advantage of Alberta’s oil rush—part of the long tradition of East Coasters who seek gainful employment elsewhere when they can’t find it in the homeland they love so much. Katie encounters the harsh reality of life in the oil sands, where trauma is an everyday occurrence yet is never discussed.Beaton’s natural cartooning prowess is on full display as she draws colossal machinery and mammoth vehicles set against a sublime Albertan backdrop of wildlife, northern lights, and boreal forest. Her first full length graphic narrative, Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands is an untold story of Canada: a country that prides itself on its egalitarian ethos and natural beauty while simultaneously exploiting both the riches of its land and the humanity of its people.Ducks is available for purchase at greedyreads.com!

Or how these businesses can innovate and stay current through the ages?Singapore is home to many heritage businesses, many with decades of history in their respective trades. They may be helmed by craftspeople with unique talents in creating traditional effigies and religious products, or culinary experts passionate about preserving our food heritage. No matter the industry, each heritage business is a precious repository of cultural knowledge. However, many of these businesses find it difficult to survive in modern times, with dwindling sales, higher operating costs, and competition from newer businesses. Join us as we talk to Ng Tze Yong of Say Tian Hng, a traditional effigy workshop, and Nicholas Tan of Sweetlands Bread and Bakery, a traditional bakery. This conversation will be moderated by Chester Matthias Tan, Founder of the Heritage Business Foundation.A﻿bout the Heritage Business FoundationThe Heritage Business Foundation is a non-profit organisation dedicated to the advancement of heritage through the supporting, networking, and promoting of heritage establishments, as well as the documenting, preserving, and disseminating of heritage material for research, education, and posterity. To that end, the Foundation works directly with a wide variety of heritage businesses and artisans to help them survive and compete in the modern marketplace. By ensuring the sustainability of these businesses, the Foundation aims to ensure the protection and transmission of their cultural heritage.A﻿bout Say Tian HngSay Tian Hng is a traditional effigy workshop that bears a long, rich history – even longer than some of the artefacts present in their shop at 35 Neil Road. Over the years, Say Tian Hng has supplied countless examples of their work to the largest temples and the most modest home altars. They are a family-run business, and multiple generations of their artisans have been plying and passing down this trade since 1896. Today, Say Tian Hng is one of the last remaining Taoist effigy-carving workshops left in Singapore, and is gradually developing new plans to keep the business growing with the times.A﻿bout Sweetlands Bread and BakeryTucked away on a side street, away from the hustle and bustle of Balestier Road, is Sweetlands Bread and Bakery. Founded in 1960 as Kim Keat Bakery, Sweetlands began by supplying bread to the many coffee shops clustered in the Balestier area. Their 南洋面包 (Nanyang bread), a traditional bread loaf first popularised in coffee shops across Singapore, was and continues to be a crowd favourite. From old-school staples like rainbow bread to Western favourites like ciabatta, Sweetlands boasts a diverse range of over fifty different products which they supply to both walk-in customers and F&B businesses alike.",https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/qixi-fest-65328388883,https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/sustaining-heritage-businesses-say-tian-hng-sweetlands-bakery-13-aug-tickets-681522250397,Singapore

Hong-ik is a Korean word for the desire “to widely benefit all humankind.” Lee believes that his movement can help individuals discover the Hong-ik spirit which all humans are capable of. He states that recovering the Hong-ik spirit is like returning to a time when humanity lived as one family and humbly recognized its dependence on the earth.Some say that the environmental movement began when the first rocket was launched into space and we saw photos of the earth, the “blue marble” floating in space. That was only about 50 years ago. Since then, we have learned a lot about the earth, and about the human brain. Lee believes there is a relationship between the two: Humans created the industries that pollute in the earth, so it is humanity’s responsibility to solve the problems; Lee believes the necessary solutions already lie within the human brain.The Earth Citizen movement claims it is devoted to “recovering our humanity and hope for the earth.” They believe the first step is for people to identify themselves as Earth Citizens, and to put that identity above nationality, race, or religion. There is hope for the earth, they state, because humans are able to change.From Brain World Magazine article, ""The 'Earth Citizen' Movement"" ( https://brainworldmagazine.com/earth-citizen-movement/ )Parking lot entranceMeeting Point @ 10AM in the pier parking lot",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/brea-body-brain-yoga-taichi-17297260147,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/earth-citizens-taichi-beach-clean-up-tickets-678950668727,LA

Dr. Marty Bradley, Sustainable Aviation Consultant and Educator, mkbradle@usc.edu. Dr. Bradley is a AIAA Fellow with 39 years of aerospace experience and is now a consultant and educator focused on sustainable aviation. He is an Adjunct Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Practice at USC and teaches AIAA short courses in Sustainable Aviation and Electric Aircraft.
Geoengineering, using technology to counter the effects of climate change, is a controversial topic. Some think the idea is counterproductive, as it diverts attention and resources away from reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Others feel it may be the only way to mitigate runaway climate change and buy enough time to truly convert to low carbon energy sources. Should we be studying how to use high altitude systems for observation or to alter atmospheric chemistry, or deploying reflector or scattering objects with space systems, or other possible solutions in geoengineering applications?
Some recent research studies recommend that we should be researching aviation enabled geoengineering applications, despite the high current levels of uncertainty:
""Model results indicate that solar geoengineering could offset most climate change...“ – Ken Caldeira, Stanford University, National Academies Workshop June 20, 2023
“An operational SRM [Solar Radiation Modification] deployment is the only known approach that could be deliberately implemented to cool the Earth within a few years” - Bala, Caldeira, et al.

Our aim is to give local transport, climate and countryside and nature campaigners an opportunity to share ideas and inspiration. We want to celebrate our successes and work out what we need to focus on over the next 12 months or so before a General Election and in the face of some extraordinary backlashes to taking action on health and climate grounds.A﻿lso, this year marks some notable anniversaries, it being the 30th anniversary of the first ever national anti-roads conference and major protests at Twyford Down, while it is the 60th anniversary of the infamous Beeching report.

The venue is close to Kings Cross and Euston so is still easy to get to from the North and the Midlands. We aim to put the spotlight on the existential threat to public transport and active travel as the Government cuts funding in order to allow it to build more roads. This is while the potholes on local roads get ever bigger. At the same time The Government has ordered Network Rail not to replace worn out infrastructure, creating a short term saving but costing more in the long term. The Government's obsession with making things worse is seen by its determined inaction on cutting carbon quickly enough as it now admits it won't meet its international target to cut emissions by 68% by 2030.W﻿e also want to run some sessions to give campaigners the understanding and skills to deal with some of the disingenuous and toxic messaging that is being used against cutting traffic.T﻿AN 2022 conference in BirminghamWe will have two sets of workshops, covering a variety of topics as follows, so there should be something for everyone: Lessons from Welsh Roads Review &  road policy changes in EnglandWhere to next for buses?The future of railActive travel - achieving the 2030 targetAir pollution: What next for Clean Air Zones and more?Nature / biodiversity / roadkillHow can we get planning to step off the road to nowhere?Campaign messaging - mythbusting and reclaiming the narrativeMedia training - how to write a press release, appear on radio / TV The event will provide the perfect opportunity for networking and meeting people you mostly only ever see on a screen.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive [CSRD] has to be incorporated into member state law by 2024, and with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards [ESRS] being adopted in June this year, businesses are scrambling. They need to prepare existing systems and processes or overhaul them completely to produce consistent, comparable, and quality data that is compliant with the regulation. And they need to do this at speed. A lack of clarity as to how the upcoming regulation will impact businesses and what they will be legally obliged to disclose, combined with differing global collection standards and capabilities has meant many are already behind in their preparation for the CSRD. The pressure is building as the risk of not being CSRD compliant increases. On top of this, business must match stakeholder requirements to provide material information that stands up to scrutiny and presented in a coherent, engaging format.At Sustainability Reporting Europe 2023, a part of IMPACT Congress London, we will help you understand how  to utilise systems and processes to provide consistent, comparable, and reliable data in an automated fashion, explore how sustainability can work closer and more effectively together with finance, risk, and legal teams, and how businesses can meet regulatory requirements while not losing sight of the ‘why’ we report.F﻿or more event information, visit the official website here: https://events.reutersevents.com/sustainable-business/reporting-europe?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_campaign=5912",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/reuters-events-65905943663,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reuters-events-sustainability-reporting-europe-2023-tickets-636464230647,London
8764,An ‘Urban Climate Walk’ Special Interest Group Event; City of London,2023-08-05 13:00:00,2023-08-05 15:30:00,"39 Finsbury Square, London, EC2A, United Kingdom","Please join us for our 6th annual Special Interest Group Urban Climate Walking tour through the City of London where we will be joined by Jane Findlay and Rosie Whicheloe, two leading experts in the field of Biodiversity net gain and Green Infrastructure. This event serves as a platform to discuss both the challenges and opportunities of creating good quality public realm and why it matters. Established in 2014, the urban climate walking tour was developed as an instructional technique for linking together diverse aspects of urban sustainability. The tour leads us through a series of urban streets and public spaces, where we explore some of the consequences of building and urban design decisions on the background climate, access to passive resources and health and wellbeing. Moreover, the tour provides an opportunity to discuss the quality of these spaces in terms of their influences on nature-based solutions and their contribution to clean and comfortable air. By physically experiencing the interdependent relationships between climate, geography, biodiversity, and green infrastructure, we gain valuable insights into how the design of cities influence access to natural resources. These include day and sunlight, ventilation, air quality, and their subsequent impacts on biodiversity and health and wellbeing. Join us on this enlightening journey as we deepen our understanding of the complex connections between urban elements and their implications for a sustainable and thriving urban environment.The walk takes between 2 and 3 hours giving plenty of time for discussion; the walk can be done under all weather conditions… In fact, the harsher the conditions the more dramatic the walk …. Sensible clothing and footwear are essential!Meeting point ❶ The Martha Smith Memorial Water Fountain - 39 Finsbury Square, London, England, EC2AFinishing Point ❾ The Thames Path London BridgeThe Urban Climate Walking Tours include the City of London, Temple, and the Paddington Basin (Central London); Birmingham (UK); Sao Paulo (Brasil); Borlänge (Sweden); Paris (France); with new walks planned for Tottenham (North London); Ipswich (Suffolk) and Barcelona (Spain).***** Dr Julie Futcher (curator); is a chartered architect from professional practice; with significant experience in both research and research-led teaching. Her research explores the direct, indirect, and dynamic influence of urban morphology in regulating the energy exchanges that characterise densely built urban landscapes. Importantly this includes the influence of built form on access to passive resources (i.e., day and sunlight and street scale ventilation), air quality and in turn, the physical outcomes on the neighbouring setting. Her research interest lies in drawing attention to many of the interdependent net-energy outcomes which currently fall outside the broader discussion on sustainable development. She is currently developing an interdisciplinary planning framework that integrates existing urban knowledge at a fundamental level.Jane Findlay; is a Landscape Architect, the Immediate Past President of the Landscape Institute, and the founding director of Fira. She is a masterplanner and designer with over 38 years’ experience of designing and delivering large and complex projects. Jane is particularly experienced in the design of the healing landscape for healthcare having worked on some of the largest and most complex healthcare projects in the UK.Jane is passionate about the psychological and physical benefits that quality landscape design and nature play in all aspects of the public realm. She is a pioneering exponent of evidence-based design and ‘green place-making’, the importance of health and wellbeing in the way that people experience our urban environment and the spaces we create within, around, and connecting places. Her interest in multifunctional green infrastructure is reflected in her design work. Whether it is creating new settlements, transportation systems, places to work and learn, or campus design, her philosophy is to lead with the green to create places that address climate change, that are climate resilient, biodiverse and are healthy.Rosie Whicheloe; is a Landscape Ecologist with a specialism in Urban ecology, Ecological Networks and Green Infrastructure. She is currently working for the London Borough of Sutton as a Biodiversity Net Gain Officer. In the last eight years she has played a key role in a number of industry leading research and design guidance including: Berkeley Homes - Nine Concepts - Designing for Nature and Beauty (2020), the Greater London Authority Green Space Factor Research (2019) and Urban Greening for BIodiversity Net Gain - a Design Guide (2021), and the first Local Nature Recovery Strategy in Hackney (2021). She has been a judge for CIRIA Big BIodiversity Challenge and past chair of the Members Branch of the Landscape Institute. Rosie has also helped set up and run Manor Park Community Garden in Newham since 2020.

Old Oak West is one of the largest regenerations schemes in the country, redeveloping industrial and railways land around the new High Speed 2 station at Old Oak Common. The Strategic Development and Infrastructure Team (SD&I) at Homes England have been working closely with the Old Oak and Park Royal Development Corporation, OPDC to prepare the five case Green Book business case for Old Oak West; acting as the lead client coordinating inputs from an array of supporting consultants and brokering relations between different public sector partners. 
The SD&I team have also, for the past three years run a mentoring programme with Oxford Brookes University Architecture School. This year we asked the students to come up with an intervention at Old Oak West that addresses one of OPDC’s golden threads while also contributing to site-wide sustainability and social value.
The students have been given free rein to interpret the brief and have come up with a variety of interventions that respond to the site and their take on addressing sustainability.
The students will be presenting their work to Homes England and OPDC on Monday 31st July in Windsor House, so come along and see what they have been up to. The session will be presented on Teams for anybody who would like to dial in.
Please use the link below to register your interest.

The OPDC golden threads are:
A local life: A place that grew for London’s workers, now set to meet the challenge of the housing crisis and workplace evolution.
Jobs for the future: A place renowned for ingenuity in manufacture and food, now primed for future big-bang industries to solve the world’s big challenges.
The middle of everywhere: A place shaped by historic innovations in infrastructure, now in a pivotal location to connect to the world, nation, city and neighbours.

We need to imagine it in some detail so as to be able to think about it clearly and constructively, and to explore some complex feelings and thoughts which may often be taboo and hard to talk about.With sturdy enough support structures in place, most people can sustain challenging feelings without either dissociating and numbing or going into blind panic. They can engage with difficult truths whilst staying connected and grounded.A climate café aims to be such a structure - a container that is strong enough to allow the exploration of fear, anxiety, and other emotions such as anger, helplessness, sadness, grief or depression.The focus of discussion is participants’ thoughts and feelings about the climate and ecological crisis. There are no guest speakers and no talks, and it is an advice-free zone.

So, now that you know what a refillery is, why are they important and why is it important to refill your products?Well, refilling reduces waste, specifically plastic waste, and in a time period where we are exponentially producing more and more plastics but are only recycling 9% of the plastic that we throw away, our whole production and consumption system needs to change.But a simple start that you can do is to ditch the “reduce, reuse, recycle” mindset that mainly just focuses on recycling, and to switch to a “reduce, reuse, REFILL” mindset. By choosing to reuse your containers rather than recycling them or tossing them in the garbage we can save resources and energy.At Refill 78, at the Burncoat Center for Arts and Wellness, you will find an ever expanding refill station stocked with body care and household products. Bring your empty containers for refill, or grab one of ours.  Pay by the ounce.Our refillery also offers ample bath, body, and household products made with minimal to no packaging, and single use alternatives for everyday life.Click here for list of items on our website: https://www.bcawworcester.com/refillery-sustainable-livingBulk products available in our RefilleryTo purchase any of our bulk refill items, please visit us in store. We are more than happy to fill containers for you upon request. Feel free to drop off your empties while you wait in your car, and we will fill for you and bring back out.

We will discuss subjects connected to the notion of 'buen vivir', biodiversity and human rights, medicinal and social uses and abuse of Ayahuasca, illicit cultivars eradication in Colombia and the strengthening of the Inga traditional knowledge and language. This event is free of charge. Register via Eventbrite to join.In the context of the masters programme Planetary Poetics, Framer Framed is excited at the opportunity to welcome Taita Hernando Chindoy for a discussion in our space. Hernando Chindoy's work focuses on the support and encouragement of traditional medicine and knowledge, as well as raising awareness on the interconnectedness between human lives and biodiversity. We will hear from him in conversation with artist Milena Bonilla, whose critical practice focuses on epistemic colonialism and the different ways in which its historical background and current structures affect organisms, language, imagery, social orders and the perception of history.As Indigenous communities around the world face extreme precarity due to colonialism and its effects, especially lasting impacts on the environment and human-non-human relationships – we welcome you to listen together with us to issues facing Chindoy's community and their efforts against colonialist erasure in its various forms. Among other topics, the discussion will address Ayahuasca's social and medicinal uses, as well as its misuse and abuse, while pointing to efforts of strengthening Inga traditional knowledge and language.Languages: Spanish & EnglishPlanetary Poetics, is a temporary masters programme at the Sandberg Instituut, organised in collaboration with artist Dorine van Meel and Framer Framed.

Across Maryland, many schools faithfully follow restorative practices and are seeing the short- and longer-term benefits described above. But what if they are just scratching the surface of the good restorative approaches can do?Schools that integrate the restorative philosophy and practices into their cultures achieve all the benefits listed above PLUS they lower their school drop-out rates, diminish the Access/Achievement Gap, raise test scores, and report higher quality of life in school climate surveys.

Devil’s Botany London Absinthe is an exquisite aperitif reminiscent of a British meadow. Distilled with a bouquet of the finest botanicals, Absinthe’s historic trinity of grand wormwood, green anise and fennel seed is expertly blended with local botanicals such as elderflower, lemon balm and meadowsweet that can be found growing wild across London.During this workshop, guests will be able to choose from a large variety of pressed flowers to be arranged on quality A4 paper during. All the necessary equipment will be provided.  Everyone walks out with their creation in a pretty envelope afterwards.Event suitable for 18+ years and older only. Maddy’s Workshop is a local East London based decor brand created by french artisan Manon Le Fer. All flowers are sourced sustainably from temperate climates. The pressing process allows us to keep and sell them all year round until the next bloom. Just like humans, every flower is unique. Thus, Maddy's Workshop tries to reveal the beauty in each of them.https://maddysworkshop.com/+Devil’s Botany is London’s first Absinthe distillery, celebrating the forgotten elixirs of London's curious past. Launched in January 2021, their original recipes call upon the traditions once mastered by the apothecaries of 18th Century London, the vast herbarium of flavours they housed and the botanical elixirs concocted. Hidden within their recipe books was a key to the origins of absinthe that had previously remained unknown. Nearly a century before the first commercial distilleries opened elsewhere in the world, London’s dram-drinkers were already enjoying a precursor to the botanical spirit made by the local apothecaries. Delightfully bittersweet and clear in colour, the noble aperitif has been praised for its revitalising flavour and found most effective in raising the spirits for over 300 years.https://www.devilsbotany.com/",https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/the-last-tuesday-society-viktor-wynd-museum-33776720489,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/pressed-flower-workshop-wildflower-spritz-with-devils-botany-tickets-649628184387,London

Kids today are growing up in a different time that isn’t comparable to any other period of the past. At the moment, a 20th Century approach to 21st Century problems simply isn’t yielding the results we need. It seems like every year there is something new that is supposed to be the answer to the challenging behaviors we face today. The only constant of all of these initiatives is that they're all flawed. If we're being honest, we also have to admit that they all have some good qualities though. In education, we have a tendency to approach deep-rooted problems with surface-level thinking which often leads to surface-level solutions.During this two-day workshop, we work together to delve into these deep-rooted problems with an appropriate depth of thinking which should yield the solutions you need to address the behavior challenges on your campus. We encourage you to join us both days but feel free to only come to the day that fits your schedule and/or interest. Please take a moment to review the descriptions of the days below so you can learn what you should expect from attending each day of the workshop.DAY 1 - RESTORATIVE PRACTICES: ALTERNATIVES TO SUSPENSION ​The concept of Restorative Practices in schools is fairly new. There are challenges in the early stages of anything new, and Restorative Practices is no exception. The greatest challenge is refuting the idea that Restorative Practices should replace traditional consequences and punishment should be eliminated. Ideally, this makes sense, but realistically, it cannot work. There will always be a need for traditional consequences in schools because there will always be situations that require us to use strategies such as in-school or out-of-school suspension. The key word to remember here is strategies. Suspension is a strategy, not a solution, and a strategy is derived from an intended goal.FOCUS #1: HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ACCOUNTABILITYAlthough Restorative Practices is necessary, it can be just as flawed as traditional consequences if executed in isolation. Restorative Practices focuses on explicitly teaching behavior to students in an effort to change undesired behavior, whereas traditional consequences are used to punish for an inappropriate behavior when we believe students should have known that what they were doing was wrong. Our goal in both instances is accountability, and the path to accountability in schools can be achieved only by making restorative practices and traditional consequences work hand in hand.FOCUS #2: ALTERNATIVES TO IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION (ISS)If we're being honest, in-school suspension has some benefits.  By and large, most students resent being assigned in-school suspension primarily because of the social isolation. Most administrators can corroborate this from firsthand experiences of students pleading for out of school suspension instead of in-school suspension. Many students would prefer to serve their punishment at home rather than being isolated from their peers at school. The greatest flaw of ISS is that you are removing the student from the learning environment and it is relatively impossible to replicate the learning environment you are removing the student from. We convince ourselves that we are still educating these students by providing them with work from their teachers and a staff member in the room, usually a paraprofessional, to ""teach"" students as needed. In reality, the overuse of ISS serves as a temporary solution that often compounds the underlying problem which eventually creates irreparable harm to the school. We have to find alternatives that extract the benefits of ISS but also compensates where ISS is deficient.FOCUS #3: PARTNERING WITH PARENTS TO HOLD STUDENTS ACCOUNTABLEOne thing that almost everyone can agree on is parenting today is drastically different than it was years ago. Many educators believe parents of students today are responsible for why we are currently seeing such a widespread of adversarial behavior in schools. You can debate whether we have a parent problem or societal problem in our country but one thing that we do know is that pointing fingers or playing the blame game isn't going to solve this problem. In fact, one could argue that the lack of trust between schools and parents is the primary barrier preventing educators from getting a handle on this problem. Leveraging partnerships with parents is paramount if educators have any hope at finding solutions to the behavior problems in our schools today. This can only be accomplished if we can convince parents to partner with us to work together in the best interest of their child rather than act as their kids' defense attorneys as many parents currently do.Day 1 of the workshop will provide participants with:a Discipline Decision-Making Process that helps ensure decision makers are making thoughtful and thorough decisions when addressing students who need to be held accountable for their behavior.a framework for creating Highly Effective Accountability that is designed to change the adverse behavior while maintaining the idea of some traditional consequences.how in-school suspension can be modified to minimize the amount of time a student is removed from the learning environment by strategically working to change the underlying behaviorsspecific alternatives to in-school suspension that can be effective in minimizing the need for traditional in-school suspensionhow educators can partner with parents in the accountability process to change adverse behaviorspecific interventions that seamlessly allow parents to be a part of the accountability processDAY 1 - WHAT TO EXPECTDAY 2 - THE ART & SCIENCE OF CHANGING BEHAVIORThe number one intention of giving students consequences is to hopefully change their behavior.  It’s safe to say no one has ever assigned a consequence without the goal of the student coming out of the consequence with a changed behavior. With that said, our problem at the moment is that many of our students’ behavior don’t change for the better after they’ve completed the assigned consequences. Whether you suspend students, in-school or out-of-school, for one, five or even ten days, the results are typically the same. They come back into the school or the classroom with the same disruptive behavior that resulted in their removal. Changing behavior requires intentionality, persistence and patience which isn’t an easy process. This training focuses on providing participants with a logical understanding about how behavior changes and the creative process for how to change behavior. FOCUS #1: TRANSFORMING TRADITIONAL CONSEQUENCESIt’s unrealistic and counterproductive to remove traditional consequences such as in-school suspension and forms of detention from schools. The issue isn’t whether they should exist but rather how to make them effective when they are necessary. When a student’s behavior is jeopardizing the integrity of the learning environment, they need to be temporarily removed from the learning environment. With that said, removing disruptive students from the learning environment is a short-term and surface level solution that, in many cases, perpetuates deeper problems. It temporarily makes us feel comfortable that something was done to address the problem but often leads to further frustration once the students return to the learning environment. The reason why many of our disruptive students’ behavior rarely change is because we rarely work to change their behavior. We assume that the punishment alone will change their behavior but the only way to change their behavior is to identify the root causes and actively work on the behavior. Many of our current traditional consequences naturally provide the structure that is necessary to allow us to work on challenging student behavior. We simply need to reimagine how these traditional consequences should look if we want better outcomes. FOCUS #2: OBJECTIVE QUESTIONINGIf you think about it, how receptive are you to unsolicited advice from an authority figure? The honest answer for most people is not too receptive. In most cases when people give advice, they are genuinely sharing their perspective to help another person. But in so many cases, advice falls on deaf ears because the person receiving the advice  isn’t receptive. It’s mind-boggling to most when they give someone what they believe is good advice, but the person’s response becomes defensive or defiant. Ironically, when the advice giver becomes the receiver, they often find themselves not too receptive either. The reason for this is people typically don’t like being told when they might be doing something wrong. A changed behavior is a personal choice that cannot be forced upon someone. The intention of the advice giver isn’t the problem in most cases. The real problem is that the greatest challenge is the delivery. As the advice giver, we believe we are teaching when we share our advice, but the advice receiver feels they are being preached to. Nobody likes to be preached to and the result is people either get defensive or shut down. If a changed behavior is a personal choice, personal reflection is required. One of the best strategies to assist with guiding someone down the path of personal reflection is the use of objective questions. Most people are familiar with the common objective questions used in Restorative Practices, such as what happened, what were you thinking of at the time, who has been affected by what you have done, and what do you think you need to do to make things right? These are great examples of foundational objective questions, but they cannot be used as a script. If the goal is a changed behavior, there must be a conscious effort to customize objective questions that encourage personal reflection. Objective Questioning is the practice of asking intuitive questions that enables a person to be reflective rather than defensive. FOCUS #3: ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECTS”Busy Work” is one of the most counterproductive things we assign students in education. It’s typically assigned to students with punitive intentions to pass time when a student is serving a consequence. Busy works comes in many forms such as make-up work, a written apology, or reflection sheets. For example, we place students in in-school suspension and provide them with assignments to work on from their teachers. The idea behind this is that the student will be able to keep up with the instruction that is taking place in the classrooms while they serve their punishment. But too often, that isn’t how it works. The greatest flaw of ISS is that it is virtually impossible to replicate the learning environment you are removing the student from. We convince ourselves that we are still educating these students by providing them with work from their teachers and by having a staff member in the room, usually a paraprofessional, to “teach” them as needed. While well intentioned, the assigning of “busy work” in these instances doesn’t yield us the results we are looking for and, in some cases, it does more harm than good.Day 2 of the workshop will provide participants with:how they can transform traditional consequences into frameworks that intentionally work to change student behavior while maintaining the structure of traditional consequenceshow to use objective questioning that is intuitive and encourages students to genuinely reflect about their behaviorhow to incorporate Structured Days, facilitate Restorative Circles and develop Accountability Projects that work together towards changing students' behaviorshow to incorporate the necessary stakeholders (i.e., teacher, parents, community members, etc.) in the school’s community to support efforts in changing the adverse behavior of some studentsDAY 2 - WHAT TO EXPECTABOUT THE PRESENTERKELVIN OLIVER is an Educational Consultant specializing in implementing Restorative Practices in Schools. As a campus administrator he played an instrumental role in the development, implementation, and support of Restorative Practices. Kelvin is credited for creating a Restorative Practices campus-based support model that included weekly professional development and an implementation support team. Since 2007, he has worked in education as a special education teacher, classroom teacher, campus math specialist, district curriculum specialist, assistant principal, campus principal and consultant.For more information about Kelvin’s work, please visit www.leavingthevillage.com.FAQsWhat's the cancellation/refund policy for this workshop?If you are unable to attend and need to request a refund, you must submit your refund request in writing SEVEN (7) DAYS prior to the scheduled date of the workshop. Submit all refund requests to billing@leavingthevillage.com. If you submit your refund request within  SEVEN (7) DAYS of the workshop, you can be provided with a credit that can be applied to any of our future workshops. Should I attend if I've already attended an Alternatives To Suspension and/or Guide To Implementing Restorative Practices virtual workshop series?Almost all of the strategies and concepts presented in the three virtual workshop sessions in both series will be presented again during the in-person workshops. With that said, the in-person workshops provide a greater opportunity to give more context because all of the strategies are presented in a day versus over the course of three 90-minute sessions.  The in-person workshops also provide an opportunity for hands-on learning activities that can't be duplicated virtually. The in-person workshop would be beneficial for those who have attended our virtual workshops but would like a refresher with some hands-on learning opportunities.Is this workshop beneficial for elementary educators?Our  workshops are differentiated to meet the needs of all levels, K-12. With that said, Kelvin Oliver, the presenter, was a PK-6 campus administrator when he implemented Restorative Practices on a campus. His time as a campus administrator is where he developed many of the concepts that are presented during these workshops. While the focus will be on all grade levels, elementary educators will not walk away from this workshop feeling that it didn't apply to them.Are these workshops only intended for administrators?No, you don't have to be an administrator to attend these workshops. All educators that attend these workshops will find great benefit in these workshops.Will I receive any supporting resources if I attend this workshop?Yes! At the conclusion of the workshop, each registered participant will be mailed one complimentary cheat sheet resource for each day of the workshop they registered to attend.  Each Cheat Sheet is strategically designed to support attendees of our workshops when they return back to their campus. If you register multiple participants for both days, you will receive the pair of complimentary cheat sheets for each paid registrant.When should I expect to receive the supporting resources?Participants who fulfill payment for their registration prior to the start of their scheduled workshop can expect their complimentary cheat sheets to be shipped to the shipping address provided at registration within two weeks after the conclusion of the workshop they attended. Participants who register using a purchase order as a promise of payment will need to fulfill the purchase order payment before their complimentary cheat sheets are shipped. Once the purchase order payment is fulfilled, participants can expect their complimentary cheat sheets to be shipped within two weeks of receipt of payment. Will lunch be provided either or both days?We've allotted one hour and 15-minutes for workshop attendees to have lunch on their own. Because most attendees work on a campus with students, they are rarely afforded the opportunity to go to a restaurant for lunch. Our hope is that each attendee takes advantage of this unique opportunity to enjoy a sit-down lunch like most other working professionals are able to do. Throughout both days, beverages such as coffee, water and hot tea will be available to all participants. ​Is there a room block available with a special room rate?Yes, please call the hotel directly at (973) 731-7007 and mention Leaving The Village to receive our group rate.Will I be able to receive CEU hours if I attend this workshop?Unfortunately, we can't guarantee that you will be able to receive continuing education units if you attend our workshops. We offer our workshops around the country and we are in the process of ensuring our attendees can earn credits in the future.How can I contact Leaving The Village if I have additional  questions?You can email us at info@leavingthevillage.com or call (301) 789-8407.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/leaving-the-village-30690050998,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/restorative-practices-transforming-traditional-consequences-newark-nj-registration-599936184277,NYC

9685,Alligator Lizards in the Air:  Integration Through Creative Expression,2023-08-26 13:00:00,2023-08-26 15:00:00,"2820 Seventh Street, Berkeley, CA 94710","Creative expression is a way to integrate phenomenon and visions experienced in altered states of consciousness, whether they be meditative or entheogenic in nature. From the very first forms of mark-making to the caves of Lascaux to the works of Pablo Amaringo and Alex Grey, humanity has sought to understand our internal landscapes through visual expression. Alligator Lizards in the Air: Healing and Integration through Creative Expression, is a once a month chance to bring these experiences to life through two dimensional mark making.Art mediums from paint to colored pencils, crayons to markers, will be available for everyone to use along with paper and canvas. Krisztina Lazar will be your visionary guide in creativity and will help you realize your experience before your eyes. No art background needed for this class. All you need is an open mind and a willingness to explore. Krisztina Lazar is a visionary artist primarily working in oil paint, watercolor and drawing. She is a Mische Technique lineage holder, a mixture of oil and egg tempera painting invented during the Dutch Renaissance and revolutionized by modern master, Ernst Fuchs. This technique creates an opalescent under painting that the colors are then glazed over, rendering each painting out of light rather than shadow, bringing the images to life with fractal clarity. Utilizing this transformative style that she learned from visionary pioneer, Brigid Marlin, her current body of work explores painting a hybrid of Mische and Alla Prima to render hyperealistic sacred art. With these two techniques combined, Krisztina creates images of Pop Shamanism, portals and visions that speak to today’s cultural climate of the occult, magic, fantasy, psychedelics, meditation, pop, nostalgia, and the environment movement. Originally from Cleveland, OH, she completed her BFA at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004 and her MFA graduate degree in 2011 at the San Francisco Art Institute New Genres department.  Her paintings have been exhibited in group and solo shows throughout the United States and Europe, most notably at the H.R. Geiger museum in Gruyere, Switzerland. She teaches her unique styles of painting to many students in group and private settings. Her work has been featured in multiple articles, galleries and book publications.  She currently lives and works in Northern California.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/the-berkeley-alembic-foundation-44559759063,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alligator-lizards-in-the-air-integration-through-creative-expression-tickets-664937023537,SF

We will have food and beverages, the artists and curator will make remarks, and we will have some live Bangladeshi folk music as well!  The ""Electric Bangladesh:  Fossil Free Futures"" exhibition will be from August 1-4 with a reception on August 2 from 5-7 pm  at The Foundry (the Point Gallery Room upstairs), 101 Rogers Street, Cambridge, MA.  This is an exhibition of artwork by five Bangladeshi artists highlighting the climate crisis and calling on the energy giant GE to stop pushing new deadly fossil fuel projects in Bangladesh. The artworks depict the people of Bangladesh and their resilience as they grapple with the compounding impacts of the climate and biodiversity crises and ecocidal fossil fuel projects.The artwork in this exhibition calls for a safe and secure future, one powered by innovative zero emission technologies like wind power that GE Vernova has the capacity to deliver.Participating artists: Monica Jahan Bose, Debashish Chakrabarty, Morshed Mishu, Ata Mojlish and AFM Moniruzzaman ’Shipu’. Curator: Zaid Islam.Presented by CLIMARTE (Arts for a Safe Climate) and commissioned by Market Forces, the exhibition will run from 1–4 August at the Point Gallery at Cambridge Foundry – right around the corner from GE’s new Boston headquarters. Gallery opening hours will be 4-8pm EDT.E﻿xhibition statement:Electric Bangladesh: Fossil Free Futures Bangladesh is at the forefront of the climate emergency, facing devastating floods and cyclones. Just this year, cyclone Mocha made landfall in Bangladesh and Myanmar, claiming over 100 lives and affecting millions. Bangladesh has also experienced record high temperatures this year.  While the people of Bangladesh are bearing the brunt of climate change made worse by fossil fuels, GE is involved in brand new liquefied natural gas (LNG) power stations. Electric Bangladesh: Fossil Free Futures is an exhibition by five Bangladeshi artists calling on one of America’s largest and most iconic companies, General Electric (GE), to stop pushing new fossil fuel projects in Bangladesh. The artworks depict the people of Bangladesh and their resilience as they grapple with the compounding impact of fossil fuel projects and climate change. It calls for a safe and secure future, one where lives and livelihoods are not disrupted, and Bangladeshis have electricity produced from renewable energy. The artists are calling out the greenwashing of GE Vernova, a new GE company, which is trying to portray a green image but is still bulldozing ahead with fossil fuels. The planned LNG power plants would not only bring harm to communities now, but also to future generations. The unwanted pollution would have adverse health impacts and contribute to further climate disasters, which are already disproportionately affecting Bangladeshi people. This group of artists are urging GE to embrace a future with electricity produced from clean, renewable energy instead. GE Vernova has the opportunity to harness its wind energy business in Bangladesh to ensure a clean energy future. Will GE stop promoting fossil fuels and choose clean, renewable alternatives? A﻿rtist statements  Monica Jahan Bose: My family is from an island in the Bay of Bengal on the frontlines of climate change. I use a combination of etching, watercolor, and sari woodblocks to create works that speak to climate change. “Bay of Bengal (Shad/Ilish fish)” is about the burning of fossil fuels leading to waters warming, harming fish and other species. “Bring Good Things to Life” uses two etching plates, plus wood blocks depicting renewable energy.	Growing up in the US, I heard the GE slogan and had positive associations with the company.  GE’s export of fossil fuel infrastructure to Bangladesh is extremely concerning to me and my family. The work shows a woman struggling in a poisoned, overheated red environment.  Both the pieces have the Bengali words “Red Blood,” a phrase and slogan from our Liberation War that is also relevant to the current existential struggle of the climate crisis. My hope is that GE will bring “good things” in the form of renewable energy to Bangladesh and abandon these terrible fossil fuel projects. I bring my own collective history into my art work: my heritage and ancestral homeland may drown under the Indian Ocean.	Debashish Chakrabarty:  In the depths of Debashish Chakrabarty’s creative journey as an artist from Bangladesh, he has been captivated by the plight of his nation, a land nestled on the periphery of the global capital centre and embroiled in intricate power politics. Through his latest work, ""Periphery's Echo,"" he seeks to shed light on the profound struggles faced by the people of his region, particularly their lack of agency when confronted with the imminent threat of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) power plant.   Bangladesh, a country with its unique cultural tapestry and vibrant heritage, is an embodiment of resilience and strength. Yet, it finds itself precariously positioned on the outskirts of the global power landscape, where decisions are often made far removed from its own voices and aspirations. It is within this context that Debashish’s artistic expression strives to reveal and amplify the silenced narratives of his people.   ""Periphery's Echo"" is a multifaceted artwork that weaves together the collective experiences of the marginalized communities affected by the LNG power plant. Through a variety of mediums—ink and digital drawings, and mixed media—he creates a visceral and thought-provoking experience that resonates with viewers and challenges the prevailing narratives of progress and development.	Morshed Mishu:  Liquefied Natural Gas or LNG power projects in Chattogram region in Bangladesh with GE Vernova’s involvement would add approximately 430 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) to the atmosphere throughout the plant’s operational lives. This is equivalent to almost double the annual national emissions of Bangladesh.  I tried to portray this particular point in this cartoon of mine, where two LNG containers are aligned in such a way that it looks like the backside (ass) of a human body. And that part is releasing CO2 gas in a form of fart and polluting the atmosphere of Bangladesh. Map of Bangladesh in the form of a lady holding a placard and protesting against this pollution.  CO2 vs See O2 (2023) Digital   GE vernova’s LNG power plants will release enormous amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas into the atmosphere. Corporations like this don’t care much about the environment and care more about making money. Profit becomes Oxygen (O2) for them and they’re so focused on that part that they can’t even see CO2 pollution.  In this particular cartoon I tried to portray this point. Where everyone can see CO2 pollution, but money makers will see what they want to see.	 Ata Mojlish : Southeast Bangladesh's Chattogram region sees General Electric’s (GE) involvement in new liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects that would emit nearly double the country's annual emissions over the plants' operational lives. We must not neglect the immediate impact of fossil fuel projects, especially GE's contributions. Consequences go beyond humanity's future, affecting livelihoods of humans and animals, erasing identities, cultures, and histories.  ""Daily Diet 01-02,"" a diptych-style multimedia piece, focuses on displacement in Chattogram's Matarbari and Moheshkhali areas. Using imagery from 2023 ads of Coal Power Plant projects, it reimagines machinery as otherworldly vessels with vivid hues, depicting abduction of humans and wildlife. This work emphasizes the urgency and prompts ethical considerations, advocating for sustainable alternatives to protect our planet and communities.  AFM Moniruzzaman ‘Shipu’  :   Light, air, water, and soil. These are our lives. They are everything to us. We are just parasites in this world. Do not pick up what you want from the ground and burn it in the air. If this earth does not survive, we will not survive. Would you?	 Curatorial note by Zaid Islam :  In grade school I learnt about the “greenhouse effect” and “global warming”, and we wrote essays on these topics. At that tender age, hope was instilled in us. We believed that if we could create enough awareness, the damage could be reversed.  Yet here we are, on the verge of extinction. Leaders struggling with promises to implement policies, and multibillion dollar lobby groups. Seas of plastic and its microgranules in living bodies, with giant cetaceans killing themselves to bring tons of our waste back to our shores. Smoke from wildfires crossing oceans into the next continent. Oil spills in the largest mangrove forest. Habitats of wildlife being encroached upon so devastatingly that species are going extinct faster than we can count. Insatiable greed. Gross violations. Unaccountability. Plundring continues.  I come from a nation of resilient people. I have experienced it in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. We continuously learn how to adapt to changing patterns. While it may be true that our nation needs energy for development, what we do not need are redundant dirty technologies being dumped on us, when clean and renewable sources are available.  This is a tiny effort to draw attention of stakeholders to GE Vernova. WE SEE YOU!

In California Against the Sea, Los Angeles Times coastal reporter Rosanna Xia asks: As climate chaos threatens the places we love so fiercely, will we finally grasp our collective capacity for change?Xia, a Pulitzer Prize finalist, investigates the impacts of engineered landscapes, the market pressures of development, and the ecological activism and political scrimmages that have carved our contemporary coastline--and foretell even greater changes to our shores. From the beaches of the Mexican border up to the sheer-cliffed North Coast, the voices of Indigenous leaders, community activists, small-town mayors, urban engineers, and tenacious environmental scientists commingle. Together, they chronicle the challenges and urgency of forging a climate-wise future. Xia's investigation takes us to Imperial Beach, Los Angeles, Pacifica, Marin City, San Francisco, and beyond, weighing the rivaling arguments, agreements, compromises, and visions governing the State of California's commitment to a coast for all. Through graceful reportage, she charts how the decisions we make today will determine where we go tomorrow: headlong into natural disaster, or toward an equitable refashioning of coastal stewardship. Rosanna Xia is an environmental reporter for the Los Angeles Times, where she specializes in stories about the coast and ocean. She was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2020 for explanatory reporting on sea level rise, which inspired the work that culminated in California Against the Sea. Her writing has been anthologized in the Best American Science and Nature Writing series.Moderator Kerri Arsenault is a literary critic, co-director of The Environmental Storytelling Studio at Brown University, contributing editor at Orion magazine, and author of Mill Town: Reckoning with What Remains.

From the Chinese in the 1850's, to Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, to successive waves of migration from India, Vietnam and Thailand in the last fifty years, each culture has left its mark on the culinary landscape of SF. And we haven’t even mentioned Latin America or Japan yet! Although the Mission District is known for being at the epicenter of Latino culture in the city, its food scene is in fact very varied - and very good.History: San Francisco has a fascinating story too. We start the tour at the Misión San Francisco de Asís, which is the birthplace of modern SF. We'll give you an overview of the city's history, from the dog days of the Spanish Empire, to being part of Mexico, to the Gold Rush era, through the Great Fire and up to today, as the city transforms once again. You'll have a chance to learn all about it.Art: We have some amazing art in the city (especially if you think of the world class museums in the Bay Area), but the Mission District is arguably the best neighborhood for public murals. We'll visit the Clarion Alley Mural Project, as well as enjoying amazing street art like the Women's Building. It's also a great way to get a better understanding of this often complicated - and sometimes misunderstood - city.Join us on our SF food tour and TRULY experience the best of San Francisco.Our tours can sell out.

Through a residency program, exhibitions and campaigns in the Kunsthalle Rostock as well as in the Botanical Garden Rostock, a dynamic and experimental platform was created and presented in 2022. Artists and scientists initiated an exchange of research, experiences and ambitions in the form of exhibitions and discussions. The aim now bringing the exhibition to Troy House Art Foundation London in a new version. Today, more and more people around the globe are directly impacted by climate change. Due to this, the perception of this topic has increased and it determines current discourses in many areas of life. As the basis for all its programmes, Troy House Art Foundation is initiating exhibitions, artists’ residencies and exchanges, performances, conversations, educational programmes, and other public and community events. What they hold in common is their identification of art with social, ethical and scientific concerns, and their use of historic buildings, sites, and special natural settings, as integral elements for the production and display of contemporary art.The exhibition On Water & Plants - Artistic Positions on Sustainability, presents  24 artists from different countries and generations in dialogue: Eva & Adele, Germany / Francisco de Almeida, Brazil / Caetano Dias, Brazil / Jaider Esbell, Brazil / José Gomes, Brazil / Rhys Himsworth, England/Germany / Sandra Vásquez de la Horra, Chile/Germany / Ingar Krauss, Germany / Alejandro Lloret, Cuba/Brazil / Paulo Neves, Brazil / Luiz Moreira, Brazil / Giacomo Orth, Germany / Jina Park, South Korea/Germany / Veronika Pfaffinger, Germany / Luzia Simons, Brazil/Germany / Vivan Sundaram, India /Armarinhos Teixeira, Brazil / Tomoyuki Ueno, Japan/Germany / Kiyomi + Tetsuhiro Uozumi, Japan/Germany /Bruno Vilela, Brazil /Thomas Wrede, Germany The show guides the visitors with current artistic confrontations related to nature in the form of installations, objects, paintings, sculptures, photographs and site-specific works focused on five topics – On The Fascination of Nature, In Symbiosis with Nature, Analysis of Nature, Exploration of Nature and The Perception of Nature. Human-induced climate change plays a greater role and impacts not only in the countryside but also in urban habitats. Scientists and artists currently accompany this scenario and the associated future global demands on humanity, as well as the development of adaptation and solution strategies and will continue to do so in the future. The perception of nature alone is not sufficient but is crucial for changing the way we interact with it. What would be effective is a transformative change in the way society thinks and acts. The future depends on a functioning eco-humanism in interaction with different sustainability-oriented world views.

9717,Burnt by Clare Frank at Napa County Library,2023-09-05 18:00:00,2023-09-05 19:00:00,"580 Coombs St., Napa, CA 94559","ABOUT THIS BOOK:When Clare Frank was 17 years old, she became a firefighter in Northern California. Clare was five foot two and too young to officially join the service—she left her birthdate blank on her paperwork, hoping no one would notice. And she didn’t look like her peers, who sported an Adam’s apple and a mustache. But her brother was a firefighter and loved it, so she thought she’d try it out, too. Very soon, she knew she’d found her calling.Burnt: A Memoir of Fighting Fire  is Clare’s inspiring, richly detailed, and open-hearted account of an extraordinary life in fire. It chronicles the transformation of a young adult determined to prove her mettle into a scarred and sensitive veteran, grappling with the weight of her duties as Chief of Fire Prevention—one of the highest-ranking women in Cal Fire history—while record-setting fires engulf her home state. Mentors and managing, funerals and scandal, pickup basketball, car crashes, and always fire—no one has written about this world, from this perspective, like Clare Frank. She masterfully mixes irreverence and awe, taking readers inside station houses, on daily calls, and along on wildfire campaigns where antics and dark humor balance terrifying risk, trauma, and a sense of almost holy responsibility. Burnt is an unforgettable memoir from an American original.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Clare Frank started firefighting in California at 17 and was promoted up the ranks, becoming the state’s first and only female Chief of Fire Protection. Along the way, she earned a BS in fire administration, an MFA in creative writing, and a JD. She has lectured at colleges, universities, and state and national fire conferences, and lives near Lake Tahoe with her husband and two dogs. This is her first book.PRAISE FOR BURNT:“A vigorous and quite timely memoir . . . Throughout the book, Frank is energetic and inspirational, especially to women considering work in the field.” —Kirkus Reviews“Good memoirs can introduce intriguing individuals and provide access to rarefied pursuits. Author Frank manages both. . . The action scenes are compelling; there are hardwon victories and excruciating losses, and Frank emerges as a relatable and thoroughly human hero.”			   —Booklist“In this evocative account of life in the firehouse, Clare Frank portrays the risks firefighters face and the stakes that are now higher than they’ve ever been. She does so with grit and a healthy sense of humor. A must-read.” —Erin Brockovich“Ominous orange skies and smoke-choked cities: The wildfire crisis is here. Burnt takes you inside. From dirt firefighter to leading thousands, Clare Frank offers a real, humorous, one-of-a-kind front-row seat to wildfires and those who fight them.” —Caroline Godkin, Executive Director of the Climate and Wildfire Institute",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/napa-bookmine-17833336597,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/burnt-by-clare-frank-at-napa-county-library-tickets-669618556127,SF

The documentary also follows mining startup The Metals Company, as it pursues funding, public favor, and permission from the International Seabed Authority to mine wide swaths of the Pacific Ocean floor.This screening is followed by a panel discussion organised by Eco-Business, The Deep-Sea Dilemma: Do We Really Need to Dig Up the Ocean Floor to Power the Energy Transition?US$8 trillion worth of precious minerals are scattered on the ocean floor. These minerals are in hot demand to make electric vehicle car batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. Six times the amount of minerals now being mined will be needed to power the energy transition and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. But mining the seabed could come at a significant environmental cost, wrecking the biodiversity of poorly understood ecosystems, ruining fisheries and altering the oxygen-carrying capacity of the ocean. Negotiations are now underway to set the rules for industrial-scale mining of the ocean floor. But do we really need to dig up the ocean floor? What are the alternatives? Our expert panel discusses the deep-sea mining dilemma.Location: ArtScience Cinema, Level 4For the full festival line-up, click HERE!Please note that there are limited seats to all talks.

Postcards from the Future, San Francisco 2123 is an interactive Augmented Reality installation that addresses these questions and invites the public to explore the past, present, and potential future transformations of San Francisco’s Embarcadero waterfront.  Postcards from the Future, San Francisco 2123 speculates on how San Francisco can develop a long-term planning framework that supports climate change resilience and biodiversity in a win-win strategy that increases the role of nature-based solutions that embrace tidal ecologies in urban environments. The project seeks to inspire collective optimism and empower informed action by reframing the challenges of sea-level rise as an opportunity for design innovation.Join students in the interdisciplinary DISC program at UC Berkeley, who will share their future visions of San Francisco that seek to address climate change, social equity, and urban health. The event will begin with a Pop-up Exhibition at the Exploratorium’s Fisher Bay Observatory followed by an Augmented Reality Tour along the Embarcadero. AR installations along the waterfront will bring to life potential future scenarios by visualizing place-based changes across time at designated locations, providing a platform to exchange knowledge and enable discourse about future sea-level rise adaptation. The public is invited to participate in this guided tour that will begin in front of the Exploratorium and end at the Ferry Building.Whether you're a technology enthusiast, a urban design buff, or simply curious about what lies ahead, this event is sure to spark your curiosity.

8939,Towards a more child-friendly London: the people making it happen,2023-11-27 09:20:00,2023-11-27 16:30:00,"26 Store Street, London, WC1E 7BT, United Kingdom","A conference hosted by the Built Environment Trust, together with author and researcher Tim Gill. 

This conference is for people that are interested in and passionate about the built environment and children’s health, wellbeing and development. You do not have to be from a built environment background, and you do not have to be an expert in child development. 
We know that the built environment plays a big role in how we feel about where we live, study and play. However, children’s needs and wishes are often overshadowed by those of adults. How do we get decision-makers to care about children? How do we support marginalised groups, and those whose voices are not yet being heard? What lessons can we learn from projects in London and elsewhere? And what are we willing to do to ensure that future generations of Londoners feel at home in their city? 

The day will offer insights and candid conversations from those at the forefront of making London’s neighbourhoods more child-friendly. Our lively panels include residents, designers, developers, and campaigners who are all making a difference. Each panel will be chaired by an expert who will also open up the discussion to all participants.  

During the breaks, attendees will have the opportunity to add to the discussion using our giant comments wall, and to experience different versions of the same street using a VR resource developed by Arup.

There’s magic in the air when we are in nature. The light through the leaves, the mist floating in the hills, the sound of rushing water, the smell of trees & flowers.  All of it captivates and soothes us—we know this intuitively, though we may not experience it daily. The natural world provides centering, grounding, and calming.Research: Most of us spend the majority of our time disconnected from the wild: Studies reveal that we spend approximately 93 percent of our time indoors—leading to what’s known as nature deficit disorder. Meanwhile, lifestyle-related diseases are the highest causes of death in the West, and they are directly related to the choices we make. But we can reverse this pattern at any time. Are you ready?Research shows that time outdoors is a critical component of overall health, benefiting us physically, mentally, and emotionally, and reconnecting us to our sense of self. This connection expands beyond the natural rhythms of our bodies and the seasons, to our contact with each other and the larger context within which we live—our environment. As the benefits become increasingly clear, doctors are even prescribing time in nature—sometimes known as forest bathing.There have been numerous experiments and field studies conducted and the results have been rosy. Forest bathing has been found to: Help in the regulation of blood pressure (Wen et al., 2019) Be beneficial to a person’s parasympathetic nervous system (sometimes called the rest and digest system), Balance out the sympathetic nervous system (that revs our adrenaline and heartbeat in times of stress),Allows the body to enter a state of relaxation (Farrow & Washburn, 2019).Improve the number of natural killer cells, which protect against disease( by killing virally infected cells )(Yu et al., 2017).Research indicates forest bathing also provides a defense against the pangs of anxiety, stress, depression, and other inflictions on one’s mind. In recognition of its potential to help, Japan has included it in its national health service as an intervention for mental health (Clarke et al., 2021). Shinrin-yoku seems to have a positive impact on post-traumatic stress disorder, has been observed to have benefits for those dealing with insomnia, and has improved the mood of people with unhealthy alcohol use (Antonelli et al., 2021). One study even did something as simple as studying facial expressions and found that people became happier by spending a few hours in the embrace of green (Wei et al., 2020). Such is the power of the forest that even video of it can induce some of the same physical reactions (Hansen et al., 2017).N﻿eed more proof? 😊Our Guide: Alison Paul has more than 15 years of experience strengthening people’s connections to themselves, others, and the place where they live.

Knowing how to effectively raise your voice for change is key to opening new opportunities for you to create impact as a leader. Change-making opportunities don’t necessarily ‘find you.’ They demand vision, bravery, and an effective brand strategy. Brand communication, or personal branding, is basically about psychology. With a brand image, you create a distinctive, unique association with your target audience. It’s your unique ideas; your values; what you bring to the world; and how you can help your audience, all tied up in how you present yourself. Pioneers and thought leaders, working for themselves or within organizations, who take a stand on important societal or environmental issues can be the catalyst for the change the world’s needs. With this bootcamp, you can find your voice, raise your visibility and join the growing movement toward business as a force for good!  Collaboration for a better worldAll meaningful change begins with knowing yourself. The way you are comfortable working. Your strengths and weaknesses. What you really enjoy and what you fear. Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your emotions, values, beliefs, behaviors, passions, purpose, etc. It shouldn’t surprise you, then, that becoming self-aware is the first step for effective personal branding too.That is why we, as The School of Life, are incredibly excited to host the Humblebrag and offer their course Positioning for Purpose as part as our training programs for professionals. The School of Life’s drive to spread greater self-awareness and The Humblebrag’s action-oriented courses make for a perfect combination to support the next generations of agenda-setting change-makers.

Works by Maria Thereza Alves, Tapfuma Gutsa, ikkibawiKrrr, Oswaldo Maciá and Uriel Orlow will be exhibited. In É a lama, é a lama, each of the artists turn their gaze to one aspect of our planet: flora, fauna, water, fire, geological formations and typhoons are some of the issues that this cohort approaches to address global warming. The artists in this exhibition are from four continents, thus bringing together various cultural backgrounds that share concerns surrounding the health of our ecosystem. They further share an understanding of the earth as a holistic body, where the wellbeing of one part is indissociable from the wellbeing of the whole. The exhibition title, Portuguese for ‘it’s the mud, it’s the mud’, is borrowed from Tom Jobim’s eponymous Águas de Março (Waters of March), which the musician wrote in both English and Portuguese. By doing so, Jobim signified the rain-showers that are characteristic of March – or at least used to be – through two geographical perspectives: the Global South, where the rains signal summer is over, and the Global North, where by turn the phenomena welcomes spring. The announcement of the mud has an eerie parallel with Maria Thereza Alves’ sculptural painting Rio Doce: Sweet No More (2017), which depicts the Samarco dam disaster from 2015 that released several dozens of millions of cubic metres of mine tailings into the Doce River, in Brazil. É a lama, é a lama is curated by Maria do Carmo M.

The documentary also follows mining startup The Metals Company, as it pursues funding, public favor, and permission from the International Seabed Authority to mine wide swaths of the Pacific Ocean floor.This screening is followed by a discussion organised by Eco-Business, The Deep-Sea Dilemma: Do We Really Need to Dig Up the Ocean Floor to Power the Energy Transition?US$8 trillion worth of precious minerals are scattered on the ocean floor. These minerals are in hot demand to make electric vehicle car batteries, solar panels and wind turbines. Six times the amount of minerals now being mined will be needed to power the energy transition and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. But mining the seabed could come at a significant environmental cost, wrecking the biodiversity of poorly understood ecosystems, ruining fisheries and altering the oxygen-carrying capacity of the ocean. Negotiations are now underway to set the rules for industrial-scale mining of the ocean floor. But do we really need to dig up the ocean floor? What are the alternatives? Together, we discuss the deep-sea mining dilemma.Location: ArtScience Cinema, Level 4For the full festival line-up, click HERE!Please note that there are limited seats to all talks.

What we do in the next five years will impact the next five decades. If we are going to protect our personal rights, our communities, and democracy itself, we need to build the biggest movement possible. We need to consolidate women and allies around shared values, experience, and culture to build a nation that works for all of us. The 2023 Women’s Convention will provide a space for you to rejuvenate and find connection and support. Whether you are brand new to social change work or a veteran activist, this space is built for you.  You will gain tools, make connections, and experience the feminist future we want to live in. While Women’s March is a key vehicle for the new power of everyday women, our Women’s Convention connects you to the network of the movement and equips you with the skills, training, and opportunities you’ll need to become change agents in your own communities.  Learn more: www.thewomensconvention.com FAQsWhat is the Women's Convention?The Women’s Convention is a weekend of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums, creative expression, and intersectional movement building. It will be a place where cause, community, and creativity intersect. We will provide a space where people can meet, share common interests, and engage on issues of civic engagement, accelerated by pop culture. We will engage activists by melding traditional organizing programming with non-traditional programming, including salons, art spaces, screenings, social programming, and women’s workforce development. This convention will leverage the power of culture shift through skilling up and storytelling to create an empowered space of feminist momentum. This event will mobilize and unite movements for gender justice, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, and environmental justice and bring thousands of participants to combine activism and creative expression among everyday people. When and where is it? The Women’s Convention will run from Friday, October 20, to Sunday, October 22, 2023. The location is the Baird Center in Milwaukee, WI. Visit  www.thewomensconvention.com  to learn more about transportation, lodging, and to find our feminist guide to visiting Milwaukee.How much does it cost?General admission is $350 per person—an amount that covers the full cost of entrance to the Women's Convention. If your employer is paying for your registration, we ask that you please register at the institutional level, $555 per person.

If you're interested in getting more information about scholarships, please click here.Why Wisconsin? We’re continuing to build on the success of the 2022 Women’s Convention by hosting it in Wisconsin for 2023 & 2024. Wisconsin is a vitally important state in 2024. Referred to as the incubator for our country’s tribal politics, many pundits think that Wisconsin is one of the states that will be both a deciding factor in the 2024 Presidential election and one that demonstrates the deep polarization that characterizes U.S. politics. With strong organizing, Wisconsin is flippable and Women’s March has the ability to make an impact on the outcome of the election. Women’s March has been making strategic interventions in Wisconsin since 2022, through both mobilizations and electoral strategies. The Women’s Convention will continue that investment with those women and communities who are the backbone and future of Wisconsin. We know that Women’s March belongs to our marchers and that they are the ones that make a change in whatever place they call home. We can support, connect, and amplify what they are doing and can do in their own backyards.Who will be there?The Women’s Convention will bring together over a thousand everyday women activists, allies, movement leaders, rising political stars that reflect our nation’s changing demographics, and thousands of new grassroots leaders who’ve organized in their communities and taken to the streets since January 2017. We hope to make this one of the largest convenings of its kind, and a unique opportunity for everyday women and our allies—from all backgrounds, and experiences—to learn together, share expertise, and unite around collective goals and strategies.What is the program? What can attendees expect? We are developing a program of workshops, strategy sessions, inspiring forums, and intersectional movement building based on the input, ideas, and efforts of organizers from our grassroots movements. Attendees—regardless of prior experience—can expect to be inspired, challenged, connected, and educated. The goal of the Women’s Convention is for participants to leave inspired and motivated, with new connections, skills, and strategies for working towards a collective feminist future. Visit www.thewomensconvention.com  for up-to-date programming information. Want to submit a workshop or idea for consideration?

10664,Anti-American Propaganda & Its Impacts in Taiwan’s Information Environment,2023-08-09 11:00:00,2023-08-09 12:30:00,"1836 Jefferson Pl NW, Washington, DC 20036","The past year has seen ever-growing prominence in Taiwan’s information environment for “America Skepticism Theory” (in Mandarin, “疑美論”): a broad set of narratives that depicts the United States as an unreliable partner for Taiwan, and one that will withdraw its political and security support for Taiwan when it suits US interests to do so. This narrative has its origin in anti-American propaganda produced by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which is intended to undermine the closer relations formed between Taiwan and the United States in recent years. Despite its origins as a hostile propaganda campaign intended to undermine Taiwanese resilience against PRC pressure, “America Skepticism Theory” has emerged in both traditional and online media as a significant factor affecting public discourse in Taiwan regarding its relationship with the United States.Over the course of the past year, the Information Environment Research Center (IORG), a civil society organization based in Taiwan, has been conducting data-focused research into the content and origins of the “America Skepticism Theory” narrative, as well as its impacts on Taiwan discourse and public opinion. The Global Taiwan Institute (GTI) has also been performing research for a separate narrative report on this topic, which is intended to provide illustrative case studies as to how this narrative has affected Taiwan’s information environment. In this launch event and public discussion seminar, each organization will discuss their parallel and complementary reports on this topic: IORG Co-Director Mr. Chihhao Yu will discuss the contents of IORG’s new report US Skepticism and Where It Came From, while GTI Deputy Director John Dotson will provide an overview of GTI’s report Taiwan as the “Abandoned Chess Piece”: “America Skepticism Theory” in Taiwan’s Information Environment. The discussants for this event will also include Dr. Wei-Ping Li, a former journalist in Taiwan and current academic researcher in journalism, who will discuss the presence of disinformation in Taiwan’s media environment; and Mr. Benjamin Sando, a graduate student at Georgetown University who has spent the past year in Taiwan, studying civil society responses to online propaganda and disinformation. The panelist presentations will be followed by an open discussion and audience Q&A, moderated by Mr. Dotson.The event will be held at the GTI office located at 1836 Jefferson Place NW in Washington DC (approximately one block from the Dupont Circle Metro). Doors will open at 10:30 AM, and the event will begin at 11:00 AM. If you plan on attending in-person, please RSVP by August 7th, as seating is limited. A light lunch will be provided. Please direct questions or concerns to Program Manager Marshall Reid at mreid@globaltaiwan.org.**Media: Please contact Marshall Reid at mreid@globaltaiwan.org if you would like to bring additional crew members or equipment, so that we can be sure to accommodate you.The Speakers:Chihhao Yu is a software engineer and information designer, and co-director of the Taiwan Information Environment Research Center (IORG) based in Taipei, Taiwan. Chihhao coordinates scientific research, data engineering, community engagement, and international exchange at the center, directing organizational capacity towards safeguarding election integrity and building democratic resilience in Taiwan. He is also a contributor to g0v (pronounced “gov-zero”), Taiwan’s civic hacking community, and an organizer of Facing the Ocean, a West Pacific civic hacking network.Dr. Wei-Ping Li earned her Ph.D. from the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism. Her research interests include propaganda, social media content moderation, and digital privacy challenges. Prior to entering academia, she worked as a consultant in the field of digital human rights. She has also worked as a journalist for Taiwanese media outlets. Wei-Ping Li received her LL.M. (Master of Laws) from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and has been admitted to the New York State Bar as an attorney to practice law since 2009. Benjamin Sando is a current M.A. student in the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. He has spent the past year in Taiwan as a research fellow with DoubleThink Lab, a civil society organization dedicated to strengthening Taiwan society’s resilience against online disinformation and malign Chinese influence operations. Ben is the current recipient of a Global Taiwan Institute scholarship to support this research work.

There are no cupcakes – we get you ""real"" food and tell you real history.Food: From French newcomers in the nineteenth century, to Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, to successive waves of migration from China, Vietnam and Thailand in the last fifty years, each culture has left its mark on Los Angeles' culinary landscape. And we haven’t even mentioned Latin America or Japan yet! On this tour you’ll eat some of the best food that LA has to offer.History: Los Angeles has a fascinating story too. Many of its oldest buildings, from when the tiny pueblo was infamous for being the most lawless and violent town in the Wild West, are still standing and you’ll even go inside one on this tour. Thought L.A. was just movie stars, beaches and Beverly Hills?

See Eventbrite's troubleshooting FAQ here.Tickets:This event is free to attend. Registration is required in advance.About Set Adrift. . .In January, 1958, a renowned sailing family was lost in a storm in the Bermuda Triangle. The youngest of two daughters, Sarah, suddenly an orphan, grew up never knowing her parents and grandparents. As an adult, she began to pursue the mystery of her family and their disappearance, and discovered that their stories were far different from the versions she was told. Sarah Conover’s memoir follows the national media’s investigation of the Revonoc’s vanishing, and exposes the truths that led her to “unstory” the family history, creating a new understanding of their lives, and hers.About Interrogating Travel. . .Never in human history has travel been so accessible to so many. But—amid an escalating climate crisis that threatens the homes of vulnerable people across the world—has the human cost of trekking the globe become too high? Paul Lindholdt links firsthand narratives with research about the travel trade, telling stories of his reluctant voyages while arguing that carbon-intensive trips abroad may be offset if adventurers come to know and love the landscapes closer to home. Tourism may be the planet’s largest industry, but Interrogating Travel advises readers to stay mindful of the consequences of their journeys, whether visiting local getaways or some of Earth’s most remote locations.Sarah Conover holds a BA in religious studies from the University of Colorado and an MFA in Creative Writing from Eastern Washington University. Her poetry, essays and interviews have been published in a variety of literary journals and anthologies including The Sun Magazine, and she is a feature writer and columnist for Tricycle Magazine: The Buddhist Review. She is an award-winning author of six books on world wisdom traditions and spirituality. A recipient of a Washington GAP Grant (Grants for Artists’ Projects), she has also received fellowships from the Ucross Foundation and the Willapa Bay Artist in Residence program. Her memoir, Set Adrift: My Family’s Disappearance in the Bermuda Triangle, a Mystery and a Memoir, will be released in June by 55 Fathoms Press. The History Channel, with a team of scientists and divers, is creating an episode of their Into the Bermuda Triangle series exploring the Conover family tragedy and aiming to find her family’s sunken yacht.Paul Lindholdt, Professor of English and Philosophy at Eastern Washington University, teaches literature and environmental humanities. Coming of age in Seattle and on Vashon Island, he studied in Bellingham at Fairhaven College under Annie Dillard and is working on a biography of her. He has published some 200 books, chapters, journal articles, essays, columns, reviews, and poems and serves several environmental organizations. Besides recognition from the Academy of American Poets and the Society of Professional Journalists, he won a Washington State Book Award in 2012 for In Earshot of Water.

Naked =Nudity is mandatory, but we make accommodations for accessibility. For example, we recognize that people need different tools for managing menstruation. Having your period doesn’t necessitate wearing bottoms though; it’s okay if your tampon string shows, or you leak a bit on your mat & towel. Participants may opt to use items such as binders, bottoms, or prosthetics to manage trauma or gender dysphoria. The goal of being Naked! is to practice self-compassion and body acceptance, which requires experiencing bodies as they are, and this can be challenging for many people. The purpose of accommodations is not to avoid this challenge, but to remove obstacles which prevent engaging with it.As with comments about others' appearance, we do not allow comments on others' accommodations. If you have a concern, ask us privately. These examples are not an exhaustive list, so if you need accommodation, just talk to us.Please bring a valid photo I.D. for age verification.

Do not knock or disrupt class in an attempt to gain late entry.NOTE: Unfortunately, Aether is not currently wheelchair-accessible.

There is paid metered parking along all the side streets, and multiple all-day parking lots right by the studio.

If you have a concern, ask us privately. These examples are not an exhaustive list, so if you need accommodation, just talk to us.Everyone MUST be an active, willing participant and at least 18 years old.Consent: All physical contact must be consensual. We’ll provide a system for silently opting-out of adjustments during class. If you opt-in to adjustments, the instructors will ask for verbal consent before offering touch corrections. You can change your mind at any time, and any answer is acceptable, so know your boundaries. Anything less than an enthusiastic “yes” means “no.” Our consent policy applies to all situations, including physical contact that may seem appropriate in a clothed setting (e.g. hugs, moving through a crowd), so ask for permission before touching anyone before, during, and after class, even while clothed.No Cruising: Please abide by the desexualized atmosphere of our classes. Don’t ask to meet up with people outside of class. Nudity is not an invitation for personal advances. Also, please do not make any comments about anyone’s appearance (e.g., “You have a nice body,” “Your hair is pretty”). We’ll prioritize the experience of the recipient over the intention of a “compliment”, so err on the side of caution! This applies to live events & online platforms (e.g. Meetup, Patreon).Be Respectful: We welcome all adults who abide by our rules and treat others with respect. Body-shaming or hateful comments of any kind will not be tolerated. Be aware of your gaze: it’s okay to look around if you get lost during the movement, but take care not to stare or focus intently on others.Cell Phones: Cell phones are strictly prohibited while clothes are off, including after class, so please silence them and put them away. If you need to use your phone while anyone is Naked!, please put on clothes and exit the studio. The Erection Question: Signs of arousal such as erections are physiological responses that are as involuntary as sweating. If you experience observable arousal during movement class, just ignore it, or take Child’s Pose if you prefer. If you exhibit signs of arousal while socializing after class, please put on clothing for the comfort of some participants.No Latecomers:  Everyone is expected to be on time to hear the rules (even if you've heard them before). The instructor is permitted to close the entrance five minutes beyond the scheduled start time. Once clothes are off, no further entry will be permitted, NO EXCEPTIONS, and we don't refund latecomers. Please do not knock or disrupt class in an attempt to gain late entry.No Lingering: Following the conclusion of class, please exit the premises in a reasonable amount of time as directed by the instructor. Do not wait to be alone with an instructor or student after class.Be Sober: Sobriety is mandatory. If you exhibit signs of intoxication, we may ask you to leave.Responsible Use of Props: We strongly encourage you to bring your own mat & towel, but some of our studios have mats available to rent. If you rent a mat, YOU MUST BRING A TOWEL. Please do not let mats, props, or straps come into contact with your genitals. Be mindful: don’t sit on communal studio props, and put blankets or bolsters UNDER your mat.If you experience or witness a rule violation, please notify your teacher ASAP to help us identify people involved, and you will remain anonymous. While we prefer to be notified in person, you can also email us at info@nakedinmotion.com. The instructor reserves the right to ask anyone to leave, and Naked in Motion management reserves the right to revoke further class privileges._______________Want to support the Naked! mission?

From the Chinese in the 1850's, to Italian immigrants of the early twentieth century, to successive waves of migration from India, Vietnam and Thailand in the last fifty years, each culture has left its mark on the culinary landscape of SF. And we haven’t even mentioned Latin America or Japan yet! Although the Mission District is known for being at the epicenter of Latino culture in the city, its food scene is in fact very varied - and very good.History: San Francisco has a fascinating story too. We start the tour at the Misión San Francisco de Asís, which is the birthplace of modern SF. We'll give you an overview of the city's history, from the dog days of the Spanish Empire, to being part of Mexico, to the Gold Rush era, through the Great Fire and up to today, as the city transforms once again. You'll have a chance to learn all about it.Art: We have some amazing art in the city (especially if you think of the world class museums in the Bay Area), but the Mission District is arguably the best neighborhood for public murals. We'll visit the Clarion Alley Mural Project, as well as enjoying amazing street art like the Women's Building. It's also a great way to get a better understanding of this often complicated - and sometimes misunderstood - city.Join us on our SF food tour and TRULY experience the best of San Francisco.Our tours can sell out.

The screening will begin at 6:30pm with an introduction of Joseph Mays together with the director's storytelling behind the scenes, after the movie we will have a Q&A.This is a fundraising event to finance our next project ""Living Libraries"", a docu-series to document ancient knowledge from First Nations of Latin America in order to safeguard endangered wisdom for the next generations and humanity as a whole, focusing on elders and their knowledge of sacred plants and rituals. Eskawata Kayawai - The Spirit of Transformation is a message of hope, an example for the world, a powerful return home illustrating the possibility of rescuing ancestral values and living in harmony with ourselves and the planet. It is a valuable lesson in our current need for cultural preservation and sustainability, and re-connecting to our true nature. A breath of hope for all of us living in this post-pandemic era.Get to know more about the film at its website or instagram.Also learn here about all first nation projects from Bem-te-vi Cultural Productions.*﻿Synopsis: In the heart of the Amazon Rainforest, the self-claimed Huni Kuin (meaning true people) are experiencing a renaissance of their culture, after decades of slavery and being forbidden to live their identity. It was only in the year 2000 they started to remember who they really are through communing with their sacred medicine nixi pae (ayahuasca) within their community. Their identity has since returned after more than the 20 years of prayers and cultural strengthening undertaken by the spiritual leader Ninawá Pai da Mata and his village Novo Futuro, and the communities along the Humaitá River. Through this film, we are guided by the villagers through the enchanting cacophony of the forest, understanding the significance of culture and identity to the Huni Kuin people.Speaker: Lara Jacoski is a documentarist, co-director of Bem-te-vi Produções together with Patrick Belem since 2012, a Brazilian independent film production company making collaborations across 5 continents. Lara has deepened her work in ethnographic projects focused to register culture referring to ancestral knowledge. For the past years she has focused to learn and work with the first nations in Brazil such as Guarani, Yawalapiti, Xavante, Kuikuro, Karajá and Huni Kui which she has recently finished the feature and 6 years project Eskawata Kayawai for a US premiere at the PS2023 MAPS Conference. This coexistence with indigenous peoples has changed her life and ways of perceiving reality, cultivating a spiritual depth through her work. Her current project ""Living Libraries"" focuses on documenting endangered wisdom from first nations in Brazil and beyond.S﻿peakers: Joseph Mays received his MSc in Ethnobotany from the University of Kent researching responses to globalization by the Yanesha of central Peru. Graduating with biology and anthropology degrees from Virginia Commonwealth University, he published a medicinal plant guide for the Jama-Coaque Ecological Reserve in the Ecuadorian cloud forest. Joseph also holds a certificate in Psychedelic Assisted Therapies from Naropa University, and his conservation work explores how cultural-conditioning influences approaches to biocultural sustainability. His Indigenous rights advocacy stresses the importance of ground-up structures that emphasize local agency and challenge conventional philanthropic models in attempts to support Indigenous autonomy and biodiversity. Joseph is Program Director of Chacruna’s Indigenous Reciprocity Initiative (IRI), where he partners with Indigenous community organizations throughout the Americas to support Chacruna’s mission of increasing cultural reciprocity in the psychedelic space, raising unconditional funding and engaging with local stakeholders on their own terms.Collab - The MoCo Psychedelic Society is an open organization dedicated to facilitating the safe emergence of psychedelics through education and meet-ups in Montgomery County, Maryland. We seek to educate on the safe use of psychedelics, while honoring the indigenous cultures from which our knowledge of them derives.  The MoCo Psychedelic Society does not get involved in buying, selling, or finding illicit substances.  Our meetings are sober and open to the public.[﻿Film Main Credits]Director : Lara Jacoski and Patrick BelemD.O.P : Lara Jacoski and Patrick BelemIn association with: Ninawá Pai da Mata and Txai Vinícius Yube Ika Ni BaiProduction: Bem-te-vi ProduçõesCo-Producer : Joakim Vocke Hauge (Hinterland)Executive producer: Oona Chaplin (Double Rainbow Productions), Torstein Grude (Piraya), Alex Moreno (Cine-Creative Media)Co-executive producers: Lucía Alonso, Bodhi Kaya, Coco Amos and Kristen NicoleSound: Origens Sound Farm – Andreia FreireM﻿usic: The Huni Kuin PeopleMain cast: Ninawá Pai Da Mata, Ikamuru Huni Kuin, Yube Dua Bake, Txana Tuwe, Dua Buse Dua Bake / Huni Kuin indigenous people.This work received grants from the Brazilian Show Me The Fund (powered by Brazilian Content, Cinema do Brasil, Projeto Paradiso) plus a 2 years support of international collective funding from kind souls all over the world.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/lara-jacoski-67677790373,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/eskawata-kayawai-in-kensington-unreleased-film-from-the-amazon-tickets-688205931467,DC

Advanced analysis, simulation, and collaborative workflows enable a more data-driven and efficient design process, facilitating the testing and optimization of ideas in ways that were previously not possible. With the right design ideas supported by the right technological solutions, a more harmonious relationship between nature and the built environment can be made, for the benefit of both. Engage in interactive discussions and Q&A sessions that explore regenerative design principles and new digital tools that power the data-driven approach to design.Esteemed speakers, including Leonard Ng, winner of the 2023 Designer of the Year award at the President*s Design Awards, will share their experiences and insights.

10372,Sustainability and Data-First  Future to Enhance Customer  Experience,2023-09-21 12:00:00,2023-09-21 14:30:00,"80 Bras Basah Road, Singapore, 189560, Singapore","Strategic Imperatives: Architecting an intrinsically sustainable, data-first, and hybrid by design future  In the current era of digital transformation and sustainability, businesses worldwide are increasingly acknowledging the profound impact of adopting an edge-centric, cloud-enabled, data-driven, and AI-empowered approach. This shift in focus holds the potential to revolutionise industries and drive innovation and efficiency to unprecedented levels. Singapore's organisations stand out as leading example in embracing a sustainable digital future. These efforts are contributing to the nation's economic growth and positioning it as a dominant force in the digital age for long-term economic viability. Research shows that businesses combining sustainability and digital transformation are 2.5 times more likely to become top performers. Achieving this requires balancing sustainability and digital efforts, aligning technology, managing data effectively, driving revenue growth, enhancing efficiency, and reducing carbon footprint from edge to cloud.  According to Gartner, 86% of business leaders view sustainability as an investment that safeguards their organisation from disruption. 80% of leaders reported that sustainability optimised costs, and 83% said it created short- and long-term value for their organisations. However, the idea of solely migrating all workloads to the cloud overlooks the complexity of a multi-gen IT environment, the reality of multiple clouds, and the ever-expanding edge computing. Sustainable IT involves more than just moving workloads to the cloud. According to IDC, 70% of apps and data remain in data centres, colocations and edges, for reasons like low latency needs, data governance policies, sovereignty, compliance, or the entangled applications typical of traditional IT.  The shift towards a data-first world, characterised by its increasing data-intensive nature, AI-powered technologies, and API-driven systems, introduces complexities related to data security, privacy, and the need to balance innovation and sustainability.  Organisations must cultivate a strategic vision, foster teamwork, and demonstrate a commitment to a future where data takes precedence while upholding sustainable responsibilities. By prioritising these aspects, they can navigate these challenges effectively and drive sustainable innovation forward. Customer Experience-Driven Data Strategy:  Harnessing data to align with customer-centric goals can elevate customer satisfaction and loyalty.

10720,Naomi Klein | DOPPELGANGER at GWU Betts Theatre,2023-09-13 19:00:00,2023-09-13 20:00:00,"800 21st St NW, Washington, DC 20052","""If ever a book was necessary, it's this one."" --Bill McKibben""Thoughtful and honest . . . Incisive . . . Klein moves her reader toward the truer grounds of solidarity in these times."" --Judith ButlerWhat if you woke up one morning and found you'd acquired another self--a double who was almost you and yet not you at all? What if that double shared many of your preoccupations but, in a twisted, upside-down way, furthered the very causes you'd devoted your life to fighting against?Not long ago, the celebrated activist and public intellectual Naomi Klein had just such an experience--she was confronted with a doppelganger whose views she found abhorrent but whose name and public persona were sufficiently similar to her own that many people got confused about who was who. Destabilized, she lost her bearings, until she began to understand the experience as one manifestation of a strangeness many of us have come to know but struggle to define: AI-generated text is blurring the line between genuine and spurious communication; New Age wellness entrepreneurs turned anti-vaxxers are scrambling familiar political allegiances of left and right; and liberal democracies are teetering on the edge of absurdist authoritarianism, even as the oceans rise. Under such conditions, reality itself seems to have become unmoored. Is there a cure for our moment of collective vertigo?Naomi Klein is one of our most trenchant and influential social critics, an essential analyst of what branding, austerity, and climate profiteering have done to our societies and souls. Here she turns her gaze inward to our psychic landscapes, and outward to the possibilities for building hope amid intersecting economic, medical, and political crises. With the assistance of Sigmund Freud, Jordan Peele, Alfred Hitchcock, and bell hooks, among other accomplices, Klein uses wry humor and a keen sense of the ridiculous to face the strange doubles that haunt us--and that have come to feel as intimate and proximate as a warped reflection in the mirror.Combining comic memoir with chilling reportage and cobweb-clearing analysis, Klein seeks to smash that mirror and chart a path beyond despair. Doppelganger asks: What do we neglect as we polish and perfect our digital reflections? Is it possible to dispose of our doubles and overcome the pathologies of a culture of multiplication? Can we create a politics of collective care and undertake a true reckoning with historical crimes? The result is a revelatory treatment of the way many of us think and feel now--and an intellectual adventure story for our times.Naomi Klein is the award-winning author of international bestsellers including This Changes Everything, The Shock Doctrine, No Logo, No Is Not Enough, and On Fire, which have been published in more than thirty-five languages. She is an associate professor in the department of geography at the University of British Columbia, the founding codirector of UBC's Centre for Climate Justice, and an honorary professor of Media and Climate at Rutgers University. Her writing has appeared in leading publications around the world, and she is a columnist for The Guardian.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/politics-and-prose-17693712019,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/naomi-klein-doppelganger-at-gwu-betts-theatre-tickets-651134339337,DC

Attend IN-PERSON Only for this speaker!The DONATION button in the ticket section is for DONATIONS ONLY and does not register you for a seat.David Moulton, founder of Saving Southern Maryland’s Grassland Birds, will discuss the role Historic Sotterley has played in finding ways to bale hay while trying not to harm baby birds at the same time. Some of our most beloved species of grassland birds, such as the Eastern Meadowlark, nest only in large hay fields during May and June – often conflicting directly with the spring hay harvest.  What can be done? With Historic Sotterley’s property manager, Joe Goldsmith, David has undertaken a series of experiments to demonstrate that by altering harvest techniques, timing and patterns, Southern Maryland hay farmers can often maintain their haying operations while significantly increasing the reproductive success of the birds.  He will outline their findings and share ideas about maintaining our agricultural heritage and conserving our threatened wildlife.David Moulton has been an avid birder since he was a boy in Massachusetts, where he accompanied his dad to such birding hotspots as Plum Island, Cape Ann and the Great Meadows of Concord. He moved to Washington, DC to attend law school at Georgetown and to pursue a professional career working on energy, environment and climate policy in the US House of Representatives. Now in retirement, David devotes much of his time to saving habitat for birds. In 2020, he initiated a nonprofit demonstration project in St. Mary’s County – Saving Southern Maryland’s Grassland Birds. This project experiments with bird-friendly hay mowing techniques that can lessen the mortality of grassland birds during the breeding season. Through the “Grassland Ambassadors” at the Southern Maryland Audubon Society, he is hoping to reduce the decline of hayfield-nesting birds with the cooperation of conservation-minded landowners.David has served as the field trip coordinator for the Southern Maryland Audubon Society, a board member of the Patuxent Tidewater Land Trust, and is currently a member of the Administrative Board of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. After six decades-worth of hours in the field, he can report a Life List for North American species that tops 700 species.This event will be in-person only.

Originally built as a private residence, the 38,000 square-foot English-style Tudor Castle sits on 55 rolling acres and is conveniently located just west of Richmond, Virginia. Prior to breaking ground in 1996, the original owners hired two local partners, Spangler and Associates, and Yoggy & Crow to handle the architecture and interior design. Spangler suggested English Country due to the grand scale and uniqueness of the owner’s vision. For two years, Yoggy & Crow traveled throughout Europe and sourced the vast majority of all décor, paintings, fireplace mantels, and furnishings from estates and auctions. The house was designed to resemble an English-style Tudor castle with heavy Gothic and Elizabethan influences.",https://www.eventbrite.com/o/dover-hall-15239741635,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/craft-beverage-showcase-supporting-the-richmond-west-trail-tickets-676023653947,DC

Davies grew up in the New Forest, and spent her childhood exploring and playing in the woods with her sister. Now, as an artist, she uses photography to examine her relationship with that natural environment, and try to reconnect with the wild landscapes of her youth. Ultimately, can those remembered and imagined places be recaptured?In her new series, ""Chalk Streams"", Davies showcases the importance of one of the world's rarest ecosystems: the chalk stream. Under threat from manmade and environmental stressors, the chalk stream provides a setting for a high biodiversity of plants and creatures, and rival rainforests and coral reefs in their ecological importance. As 85% of chalk streams are found across the UK, it was a natural progression for Davies' body of work. The forest, as a symbol in folklore and human psychology, is richly tapestried within human experience and literature. It is against, and within, this verdant background that Davies explore the natural landscape, and creates a sort of limbo zone between reality and fantasy. The temporary interventions she creates in the forest demonstrate her profound respect and love for this immense biosphere.T﻿he show will coincide with the publication of Ellie Davies' monograph.
